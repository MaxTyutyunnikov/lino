Python Document Script
======================

PDS ("Python Document Script") can be used to create formatted
documents programmatically.

PDS files are little programs who fill an abstract document with
content. Usually the result will be some output file: a PDF file, or a
Website. Or a DocBook XML file. Or an OpenOffice document.

PDS is inspired by the LaTeX text processing system.  An author could
use a plain text editor and write PDS code directly. This is similar
to LaTeX, although less comfortable. Advantage is that prosaic content
can be mixed with generated content.
