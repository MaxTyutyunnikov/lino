===========================
Adamo : Abstract Data Model
===========================

Adamo is the data model used by Lino.
It is a high-evel database interface.

Create database-oriented applications with an extensible library of
highly reusable schema modules.

Abstract: an Adamo database can run via a Web or GUI application, via
console interface, via agents, or via any combination of those.

This document introduces the special features of
Adamo.

You may prefer to look at `Pizzeria <pizzeria.html>`_ which
illustrates Adamo using a simple example.
  

Adamo features
==============

- develop reusable Entity/Relationship schemas in Python

- define business logic and design the user interface without worrying
  whether it is for a Web or a GUI application.

- Database schemas with Adamo don't use any SQL. Any SQL is
  automatically generated if necessary.

- The concept of a table is not limited to tables in a relational
  database: any data with tabular structure can become a table for
  Adamo. However currently there is only an SQL implementation of
  tables.

- Adamo manages links between tables in a transparent way.

- Adamo can also be considered as a "object relational mapper" since
  you access the database rows as objects.
