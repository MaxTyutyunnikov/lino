===================
Using TIM and Adamo
===================

Adamo databases can be maintained using TIM. In the beginning there is
a running TIM database, usually with TIM's WWW module. TIM itself can
only generate static HTML from this data.  The `TIM Website
<http://lsaffre.dyndns.org/timwebs/tim/index.htm>`_
is an example of
such a static website which has been generated by TIM.

Another approach is to let TIM export its data to an SQL script, run
this script on a newly-created SQL database, and voilà, you have a
database for Adamo.  That's why the Lino server performs an integrity
check by default.

The Lino server then uses this database to provide a
`dynamic version <http://lsaffre.dyndns.org:8088/tim/>`_
of the same old data.
