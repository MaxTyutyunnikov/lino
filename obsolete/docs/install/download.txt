=============
Download Lino
=============

.. include:: ../_header.txt

.. contents:: 


There are several methods to get Lino.

Download zipped snapshot
========================

This is the easiest method. Just click on the following link to start
downloading a relatively recent full source tree.

  http://lsaffre.dyndns.org/timwebs/lino/dl/lino-snapshot.zip

Advantage: you just need to unpack the zip file.  Disadvantage: you
must download the whole archive each time you want to do an upgrade.


Binary releases
===============

Currently there is only a quite old binary release of the `TIM Tools
<timtools.html>`_ available for download 
`here
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=87016&release_id=200339>`_.
Don't waste your time with this.


Using a SVN working copy
========================

This is recommended method in this early development state.
First you must install an SVN client on your computer. That's easy. 

- Subversion project homepage::
  http://subversion.tigris.org/

- Article "The Subversion Project: Building a Better CVS"
  http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=4768
  
- Online book "Version Control with Subversion":
  http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

Once you have `svn` installed:

  mkdir /mnt/snapshots/lino
  cd /mnt/snapshots/lino
  svn checkout svn+ssh://lsaffre.dyndns.org/mnt/svnroot/lino/trunk

Later you can always get the latest version snapshot by issuing the
command::

    svn update -dP

from the directory containing your local copy.





Using a CVS working copy
========================

Big disadvantage: you won't get the latest version since I don't keep
sourceforge up-to-date!

You need a CVS client to do this.  You don't need to know much about
CVS.  You are just going to use it to "checkout" Lino and to upgrade
your local copy from time to time to get the newest Lino version.

Install a CVS client
--------------------

For most Windows user I recommend installing TortoiseCVS, an
Open-Source project at SF.  Get it at
http://tortoisecvs.sourceforge.net/.

If you want to know more about accessing a CVS repository, see the
general SourceForge documentation:
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=87016


Get the sources
---------------

When CVS is installed on your machine, you are ready to get your local
copy of the Lino source tree.

Basically you have to checkout a module `lino` from the project `lino`
at the CVS server ``cvs.sourceforge.net``.

Using TortoiseCVS:

  Launch Windows Explorer, create an empty folder "snapshots" in the
  root of your C: drive, then right-click on that folder and choose
  "CVS checkout..."

  Copy the following text to the "CVSROOT:" field::

     :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lino
	  
  In the field "Module:", type::
  
	  lino

On a UNIX system you do something like::

    INSTALLROOT=/opt
    cd $INSTALLROOT
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs-pserver.sf.net:443/cvsroot/lino login
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs-pserver.sf.net:443/cvsroot/lino co lino
    chmod -R a+r lino

On Windows with Cygwin you would do::

   md c:\snapshot\lino
   cd c:\snapshot\lino
   cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs-pserver.sf.net:443/cvsroot/lino login
   cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs-pserver.sf.net:443/cvsroot/lino co lino


Getting up-to-date versions
---------------------------

Later you can always download the latest snapshot by issuing the
command::

    cvs update -dP

from the directory containing your local copy.
