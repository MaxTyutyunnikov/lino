#10 (Lino doesn't like multiple processes)
==========================================

Solved in :doc:`/releases/20101027`.

Lino requires Apache to be configured with

::

    WSGIDaemonProcess example.com threads=15

and not with 

::
    WSGIDaemonProcess example.com processes=2 threads=15

This is appearently not an urgent problem:

- For most sites you would get away with single process, so you 
  can drop 'processes=4' and let it default to running a single daemon 
  process and probably not see any difference given that also using 
  multithreading.

The problem when Lino is running in multiple processes appears quickly: 
the columns of most grids are mixed up. 

The reason was be that I used Python `sets` when filling the field lists 
(fields, list_fields, detail_fields) of :class:`lino.ui.extjs.ext_store.Store`. 
Each process then resulted in its own column order.
