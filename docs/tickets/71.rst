#71 : How to make Django and Jinja template machines coexist
============================================================


I personally prefer Jinja over Django's built-in template machine. 
I even rewrote the mandatory 403.html, 404.html and 500.html 
to Jinja because I wanted fit into Lino's default concept of how web 
sites should be designed.
Lino applications by default don't need 
Django's template machine.

But of course there are other people who 
have lots of classical Django templates 
and don't want to rewrite them.

They do not need to despair.
