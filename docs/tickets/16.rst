#16 : Questions about copyright 
===============================


- Question: **Are the things stated in :doc:`/about/license`
  allowed with the GPL?**


Lino and ExtJS and Ext.ensible
------------------------------

In case we decide to switch from GPL to BSD, before doing so, 
we need to check the following:

ExtJS and Ext.ensible are GPL. 
Lino uses them both.


Lino generates and serves HTML pages which contain the instruction 
to include the `*.js` and `*.css` files of these libraries.

Lino currently *needs* them, it does not currently offer a 
possibility to be used without them. 
But this possibility exists theoretically, 
and it is just a question of priorities whether we develop an 
alternative user interface which doesn't require ExtJS and Ext.ensible.

- Questions: 
  Is Lino **the framework** to be considered a derived work?
  Are Lino **applications** to be considered derived works?

(My current answer: I think not, because Lino doesn't call any functions.)


Miscellaneous
-------------

What about the copyright notice in :srcref:`/bash/oood`? 
This is based on `oooctl <http://svn.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/tools/ooo/oooctl>`_ 
(copyright "Nuxeo 2007 and contributors" and published using LGPL).
I made modifications and would like to publish my work 
independently with Lino using the GPL.
How to formulate this?
