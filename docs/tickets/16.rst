#16 : Copyright notice on derived work
======================================

What about the copyright notice in :srcref:`/bash/oood`? 
This is based on `oooctl <http://svn.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/tools/ooo/oooctl>`_ 
(copyright "Nuxeo 2007 and contributors" and published using LGPL).
I made modifications and would like to publish my work independently 
with Lino using the GPL.
How to formulate this?
