#48 [closed] : One table for all contacts
=========================================

A few changes in the database structure, 
but a big step in Lino's evolution:
Persons, Companies and Users 
get a common non-abstract model `Contact`.
This change is triggered by our need for a 
user-friendly way to add recipients to an :class:`lino.modlib.mails.models.OutMail`.
A Contact is "a Company, a Person, a User or a Group of Contacts".
