#69 : central place to store the version number
===============================================

It seems that there is no "official" possibility 
to store the version number of a Python project 
in a single central place.

Lino's :xfile:`setup.py` does an ``import lino`` to take it 
from :attr:`lino.Lino.version`. 
That's okay for me the author who just uses :xfile:`setup.py`
to `sdist` and `upload`.

But ``setup.py install`` of course wouldn't work.
