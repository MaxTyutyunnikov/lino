#70 : Allow to use Django admin on a Lino site
==============================================

The setting :attr:`django_admin_prefix <lino.Lino.django_admin_prefix>` 
doesn't yet work.
It is currently not possible to run `django.contrib.admin` 
on a Lino site because the permission systems aren't compatible.

Django 1.5 allows for 
`Substituting a custom User model
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/#auth-custom-user>`__,
but not for substituting the permission system.

It shouldn't be too difficult to make Lino's permission system optional...
but my only motivation to do this work is my (even unconfirmed) fear that other 
developers might not like Lino's permission system which
is rather young, potentially unstable and poorly documented.
