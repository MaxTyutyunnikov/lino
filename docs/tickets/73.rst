#73 : UI concept for handling OneToOne fields 
=============================================

Before I can replace MTI (Multi-Table Inheritance) 
by OneToOne fields, 
I need to find a user-friendly way for handling this.
Lino cannot yet render OneToOneFields.

Module :mod:`lino.modlib.partners` 
(which is going to replace :mod:`lino.modlib.contacts`)
is where I am experimenting with this.
