===============================================

Suggested readings before entering the discussion:

  <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#other-authentication-sources>`_
  section in the Django docs.
- `Authentication using REMOTE_USER
  <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/auth-remote-user/>`_

Request for Comments
--------------------

Don't take the following statements as my definitive opinion.
I formulated them in order to get your feedback and 
help me to understand if I were missing something.

- The :mod:`lino.modlib.users` module is useful
  on Django sites with :doc:`/topics/http_auth`
  where a central user management system is already 
  running.

- Django's :mod:`django.contrib.auth` module is overkill in 
  such cases.
  
- Not only overkill, but also it's tests suite reports many 
  failures for things that are not used in the above 
  configuration.
