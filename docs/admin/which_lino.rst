You want Lino? Which Lino?
==========================

Lino is a framework. 
In fact you don't want "just Lino",  
you'll have to decide which Lino application you want.

Soon you will probably want to 
:ref:`write your own Lino application <lino.tutorial.polls>`
or get somebody else write it for you, 
but in a first step we suggest that you choose one 
of the "batteries included" applications:

- :mod:`lino.projects.cosi` 
- :mod:`lino.projects.presto` 
- :mod:`lino_welfare` 

- :mod:`lino.projects.igen` 
  (an accounting application focussed on sales) 
  
In fact you don't even need to decide. 
Just pick a random one.
As long as you are just playing around, 
it is easy to switch between these applications 
since the only difference is one line in 
your :xfile:`settings.py` 
(one of the files we are going to create in the following section).
