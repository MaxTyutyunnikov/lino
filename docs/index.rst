Welcome to the Lino Website. 
Lino is still in pre-documentation phase,

There's much work going on right now.

- There's currently no online demo, 
  but the :doc:`installation </admin/install>` 
  is easy if you have some experience qith Python.
  
- See Luc's :doc:`Blog <blog/2012/index>` to get the hottest 
  news about what's going on here.
