Lino -- A web application framework using Django and ExtJS
==========================================================

Welcome to the Lino Website. 
Lino is still in pre-documentation phase, so don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested.

- See my :doc:`Blog <blog/2010/index>` to get the hottest news about what's going on here. 
  Currently I use Sphinx for blogging, but I tried also 
  `Blogspot (Nov 2009-Feb 2010) <http://lsaffre.blogspot.com>`__ and
  `googlecode's Wiki (Jan-June 2010) <http://code.google.com/p/lino/wiki/WikiBlog>`_
- A few documents should be relatively up-to-date: :doc:`todo` and :doc:`install`.
- But the final truth about what's going on is only `The Source Code <http://code.google.com/p/lino/source/list>`_.

Some external links:

- `Project page on Googlecode <http://code.google.com/p/lino>`__
- Demo sites: `Lino-DSBE <http://dsbe.saffre-rumma.ee>`_ and `Lino-iGen <http://igen.saffre-rumma.ee>`_.
- `PyPI entry <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lino>`_
