Lino -- a framework for database applications
=============================================

Welcome to the Lino Website. 

- :doc:`What is Lino </about/index>`?

- Linux administrators! give Lino a try,
  :doc:`install it </admin/install>` on your machine 
  and give us your feedback.
- Have a look at the :doc:`/demos` (but be patient because 
  they are served from a slow internet connection).
  
- See Luc's :doc:`Blog <blog/2012/index>` to get the hottest 
  news about what's going on here. 
- The final truth about what's going on is only 
  `The Source Code <http://code.google.com/p/lino/source/list>`_.
  Strings like "20110615" as commit message refer to the corresponding blog 
  entry :doc:`/blog/2011/0615`.
  
Lino is still in pre-documentation phase, 
so don't judge the project on this website only.
There's much work going on right now.
If you like Lino, read our :doc:`/community` page and
consider lending a helping hand.
Don't hesitate to contact the author directly 
(luc.saffre@gmail.com).
