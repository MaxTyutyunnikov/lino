Lino -- a framework for writing database applications 
=====================================================



Welcome to the Lino Website. 
Lino is still in pre-documentation phase, so don't judge the project on this website only, and don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested.

- See my :doc:`Blog <blog/2010/index>` to get the hottest news about what's going on here. (But sorry, this is mostly in German.)
- A few documents should be relatively up-to-date: :doc:`todo` and :doc:`admin/install`.
- But the final truth about what's going on is only `The Source Code <http://code.google.com/p/lino/source/list>`_.

- Welcome page for non-programmers see :doc:`/download`.
