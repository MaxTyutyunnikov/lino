Lino -- A web application framework using Django and ExtJS
==========================================================

Welcome to the Lino Website. 
Lino is still in pre-documentation phase, so don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested.

 * See my :doc:`blog <blog/2010/index>` to get the hottest news about what's going on here. 
   Currently I use Sphinx for blogging, but I tried also 
   `Blogspot (Nov 2009-Feb 2010) <http://lsaffre.blogspot.com>`__ and
   `googlecode's Wiki (Jan-June 2010) <http://code.google.com/p/lino/wiki/WikiBlog>`_
 * The following documents should be relatively up-to-date: :doc:`todo` and :doc:`install`.
 * But the final truth about what's going on is only `The Source Code <http://code.google.com/p/lino/source/list>`_.
