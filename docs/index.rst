Lino -- a framework for writing database applications 
=====================================================

Welcome to the Lino Website. 
Lino is still in pre-documentation phase, so don't judge the project on this website only.

- :doc:`What is Lino </about/index>`?
- See my :doc:`Blog <blog/2010/index>` to get the hottest news about what's going on here. (But sorry, this is mostly in German.)
- Welcome page for non-programmers see :doc:`/download`.
- Try logging into the :doc:`/demos`.
- The final truth about what's going on is only `The Source Code <http://code.google.com/p/lino/source/list>`_.
