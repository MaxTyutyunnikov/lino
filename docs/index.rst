Welcome to the Lino Website.

Status: I'm currently working a lot on 
  :mod:`~lino.django.utils` and :mod:`~lino.django.igen`.
  
  "igen" stands for "invoice generator" and is a simple, 
  web-based program to write invoices either manually or 
  periodically based on contracts.
  It should become the first application Lino Django 
  application.
  
  There is even an early `demo site <http://igen.saffre-rumma.ee>`_
