I'm currently working a lot on :mod:`~lino.django.utils` and
:mod:`~lino.django.igen`.  
"igen" stands for "invoice generator" and is a simple, 
web-based program to write invoices either manually or 
periodically based on contracts.
It should become the first application Lino Django 
application. There is even an early `demo site
<http://igen.saffre-rumma.ee>`_
