Lino -- Luc's Python Library
============================

Welcome to the Lino Website.
:doc:`what_is`.

I'm currently working heavily on *igen* which might become the first 
usable application written using Lino. 
"igen" stands for "invoice generator" and should become a simple, 
web-based program to write invoices either manually or 
periodically based on contracts.

Here is the igen demo site: http://igen.saffre-rumma.ee
