Though Lino is :doc:`really free </about/why_gpl>` software, it isn't a packaged product that you can simply download, install and use.

In order to see Lino, browse through the :doc:`example sites </demos>`. These sites serve quite different purposes, but they also have things in common. The things they have in common, that's Lino!
