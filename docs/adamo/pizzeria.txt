Pizzeria
========

The file `src/lino/examples/pizzeria.py` is a simple example to
introduce Adamo.

First day
---------

Here is the source code:

  .. include:: ../src/lino/examples/pizzeria.py
     :literal:



@{
from lino.version import __version__
}

Here is what you see if you run pizzeria::

	>>> from lino.examples.pizzeria import main
	>>> main()
	Lino version 0.5.5
	Copyright (c) 2002-2004 Luc Saffre

	See file COPYING.txt for more information.
	Adamo startup...
	  Initializing database...
	  Initializing 4 tables...
	Adamo startup okay
	Henri must pay 12 EUR
	James must pay 53 EUR

You can get the same output by simply running the `pizzeria.py` script
from the command-line.
