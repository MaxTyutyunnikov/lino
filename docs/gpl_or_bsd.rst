GPL or BSD?
-----------

The :mod:`lino.django` modules are extensions to Django. 
They need Django to work. And Django is BSD. 
So it would be the easier if I published Lino also under the BSD.
But yes, I "stubbornly" publish it under the GPL.

So you are free to use my software, you are free to change it, but if
you publish your changes, then you are not free to choose another
license for them than the GPL.

The BSD versus GPL discussion has evolved to an almost religious
dimension.  The personal preference of a software developer seems to
depend mainly on his or her life situation and beliefs. And as far as I
can see, my personal choice is clear. 

This said, I want to add that I'm not a lawyer, nor do I claim to
understand the topic completely. So I'm open to comments, critics and
discussion, and maybe I'll even change my mind.

One reason to make me change my mind might be if I hear that people who
would otherwise collaborate on Lino, refrain from doing so because of
the GPL licensing. Let me know if you are one of them.
