What is Lino?
=============

Lino is an Application Framework and a collection of standard
applications.

   * Developers_ are welcome to join the project.  There is a lot to
     do.

   * End-users_ are encouraged to co-operate with one of the
     Lino `Service Providers`_.

End-users
---------

Lino aims the low-cost Web Application market. Potential End-users are
medium-sized or small companies who understand that they need
assistance from IT experts for the analysis and setup of their
Information System and who are willing to dedicate an appropriate
budget to these services.

Service Providers
-----------------
A Lino Service Provider is a company who knows enough about Lino to be
able to give quality service to end-users. A Lino Service Provider
should have the following abilities:

* Selling:

  Know the **Standard Modules** and what they do. Know also what
  they can **not** do.

* Analysis :
  Speak with the User to find out which modules are necessary.


* System Administration

  - Install the different software products necessary to run Lino
    (Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, PHP, Python, Lino,...)
        
  - Manage databases containing customer data.
    Install backup possibilities. Explain to the User how to use
    them.  

* Maintenance

  - Training : Explain to the User how to use their Lino
    Application. 

  - Support : Answer to the User's questions.
  
  - Check continuously with the User if the analysis is correct or
    whether there are new needs.


* Take part in the development process:

  - Understand how Lino works
  - Specify requirements for new Lino Modules.
  - Test Lino modules and report bugs to a Developer.

Developers
----------

A Lino Developer is somebody who writes new Lino Modules.  Currently
there is only one such person, but I don't want to stay alone.

Since Lino is Free Software, the Lino Service Providers are not
legally bound to the developer. They can decide to rely on their own
Lino Developer.
