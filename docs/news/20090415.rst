  I'm currently working on *igen* which until end of 2009 
  should become the first usable Lino application. 
  "igen" stands for "invoice generator" and should become a simple, 
  web-based program to write invoices either manually or 
  periodically based on contracts.
  There is even an early `demo site <http://igen.saffre-rumma.ee>`_
