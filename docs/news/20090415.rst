  I'm currently working on :mod:`~lino.django.igen` 
  which should become the first usable Lino application. 
  "igen" stands for "invoice generator" and is a simple, 
  web-based program to write invoices either manually or 
  periodically based on contracts.
  There is even an early `demo site <http://igen.saffre-rumma.ee>`_
