After watching the :doc:`online demos </demos>`
you'll now want to have a look inside Lino.
Because the demo sites show just a small part, 
Lino's beauty is inside.

You may just *read* them, 
but of course we also recommend to *try them yourself*. 
For this you must first install Lino on your computer 
as explained in :doc:`/admin/install`.
