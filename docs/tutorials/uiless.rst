The UI-less Lino Polls tutorial 
===============================

Lino's "user interface" which replaces Django's "Admin" 
is a great feature, but it is much to learn and not yet 
well documented. But Lino is more than this.

This tutorial explains what Lino can do 
without any change to your existing templates and urlconfs.

It is for people who want to use Lino's basic features 
:doc:`/topics/dumpy` and :doc:`/topics/startup`.

Unlike :doc:`polls`, we are going to 
follow Django's "Polls" tutorial *until the end*
and then turn the resulting 
application into a Lino application.

Let's look together at the files under 
:srcref:`lino\apps\webless`.
After the Django polls tutorial series,
we've added only a few minor things:

(1) In :srcref:`settings.py <lino/apps/webless/mysite/settings.py>`,
a line at the beginning of the file to instantiate our :setting:`LINO`::
::

    import lino; LINO = lino.Lino(__file__,globals()) 
    
Then we add a "lino" entry to :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`::

  INSTALLED_APPS = (
      ...
      'lino'
  )
  
Note that "'lino'" must be the **last entry** of your 
:setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` because the only thing it does 
is to call :meth:`settings.LINO.startup <lino.Lino.startup>`

And finally declare a local fixture directory::

  FIXTURE_DIRS = ['fixtures']


(2) A file 
:srcref:`polls/fixtures/demo.py
<lino/apps/webless/polls/fixtures/demo.py>`,
a simple example of an "intelligent" Python fixture providing 
demo data for our application.
It is the same file as in :doc:`polls`.

That's all. 
You now have added Lino's core features to your existing Django project.

You can now reset your database to factory defaults by issuing::

  python manage.py initdb demo
  
You can make a complete python backup like this::
  
  python manage.py dumpdata > fixtures/a.py
  
And restore it like this::

  python manage.py initdb a
 
Note the difference between "intelligent" and "dumped"
fixtures:

- intelligent (written by a human):
  :srcref:`polls/fixtures/demo.py
  <lino/apps/webless/polls/fixtures/demo.py>`

- dumped (generated by the :mod:`dumpdata <lino.management.commands.dumpdata>` 
  command):
  :srcref:`fixtures/a.py
  <lino/apps/webless/fixtures/a.py>`,
