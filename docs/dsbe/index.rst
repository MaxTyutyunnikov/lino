Overview
--------
Lino/DSBE is the first of the real-world demo applications that are part of the Lino project.
It is a tool for social assistants that help receivers of public aid to find a suitable job or education, 
adapted to Belgian *Public Centres for Social Welfare* (Centres Publics d'Action Sociale).

The rest of this documentation is currently only in German since the the pilot customers are situated in the German-speaking region of Belgium.
