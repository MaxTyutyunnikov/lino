.. _eidreader:

====================
The EIDReader applet
====================

International eID card reader.
An applet to read the publicly available information 
(name, birth date, national id,...) 
on electronic ID cards of different countries and make them accessible 
to the Javascript code of a web page.

Status: 
currently supported countries are Estonia and Belgium.
The Estonian reader does not yet import the photo
(hints on how to implement this are welcome).


.. note::

    The EIDReader **code** has been moved to its own repository at
    https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader,
    the documentation is still here until I learned how to manage docs 
    on github.
