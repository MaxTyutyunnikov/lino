Double Dump Test
----------------

A `Double Dump Test` is a method to test for possible problems e.g. after a :ref:`datamig`: 
we make a first dump of the database to a Python fixture `a.py`, 
then we load that picture to the database, 
then we make a second dump to a fixture `b.py`. 
And finally we launch `diff a.py b.py` to verify that both pictures are identical.
See :ref:`dpy` for details.
