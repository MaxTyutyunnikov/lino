A `Double Dump Test` is a method to test 
for possible database problems e.g. after 
a :ref:`datamig`: 
a first dump writes a picture of the database to a Python 
fixture `a.py`, then we use `manage.py initdb a` to load that picture 
to the database, then perform a second dump to a fixture `b.py`. 
And then we launch `diff a.py b.py` to veryfy that both pictures are identical.
