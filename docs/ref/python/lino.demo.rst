The :mod:`lino.demo` Package
============================

This package exists mostly to generate documentation of the :mod:`lino.modlib` package.

You may also use the :xfile:`urls.py` here by saying in your own :xfile:`urls.py`::

  from lino.demo.urls import urlpatterns
  
  

.. automodule:: lino.demo
