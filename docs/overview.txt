Lino Overview
=============

Lino is a framework for IT professionals who offer integrated business
applications for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Lino is published under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and
implemented as a suite of Python packages.  Although these packages
could possibly be useful separately, they are designed to co-operate.

I started to publish Lino as a Sourceforge project in August 2003.
Lino is currently rather a sandbox for several modules in different
states of development and with different degrees of co-operation.  The
only thing that they have in common is that I am author and
maintainer.
