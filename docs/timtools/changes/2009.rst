I discovered that :meth:`lino.textprinter.pdfprn.PdfTextPrinter.insertImage`
has changed its behaviour between 0.6.37 and 0.6.42.
Maybe because I upgraded the ReportLab toolkit between those releases. 
Warning: PdfTextPrinter.insertImage() does not support *behindText*.
Images are always placed *over* any text that occurs before them in 
the input file.
