What is Lino?
=============

This screencast is going to give you a first impression 
about Lino: how a Lino application looks like, 
and what it can do.

Lino is a framework for developing customized database applications.
I've been working on this project during the last years and I now hope that 
other programmers will join the project 
and start to write their own Lino applications 
which they can then offer to their customers.

Here you see the Lino website. 
We are not going to read this together,
I'd rather going to show you the first real-world Lino application,
which is being used since Januar 2011 
by four users in the German-speaking part of Belgium.
The application is very specific: it is useful only for 
Public Welfare Centres, and only for Belgian ones.
But it will be enough to give a first overview about 
what Lino can do and how Lino looks like.

In fact, Lino is designed to provide different user interfaces, 
but for the moment there's only one choice, 
namely: a Rich Internet Application 
based on the ExtJS Javascript library. 
It doesn't require anything installed on the client machine.

Lino applications will usually run behind a secured web server, 
probably using HTTP authentication.
So the browser will ask once for our username and password.

Here is now the main screen of this concrete Lino application.

For reasons of privacy protection, you are of course not seeing real data. 
The persons in this database are fictive names generated for this demo.

As you can see, this application is in German.
It is being translated to French and Dutch 
because there are probably soon other Public Welfare Centres 
going to use it.

I can select the language of the user interface in the user preferences.
This site is configured to provide only three languages.
For this demo I'm going to set it to English.
