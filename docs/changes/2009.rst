Changes 2009
============

20090213
--------

Configurable boldness

Okay, it seems that not all printer drivers behave correctly when they
get «unusual» font weights. New testcase 
srcref:`tests/textprinter/3.py` 
shows whether your
configured PostScript printer does it right. On the other hand the
"Courier New" font looks «too lightweight» to many people on most
printers. So I must make this option customizable. 

N.B.: :mod:`win32.lib.win32con` defines the following names::

  FW_DONTCARE = 0 
  FW_THIN = 100 
  FW_EXTRALIGHT = 200 
  FW_LIGHT = 300 
  FW_NORMAL = 400 
  FW_MEDIUM = 500 
  FW_SEMIBOLD = 600 
  FW_BOLD = 700 
  FW_EXTRABOLD = 800 
  FW_HEAVY = 900 
  FW_ULTRALIGHT = FW_EXTRALIGHT 
  FW_REGULAR = FW_NORMAL 
  FW_DEMIBOLD = FW_SEMIBOLD 
  FW_ULTRABOLD = FW_EXTRABOLD 
  FW_BLACK = FW_HEAVY



20090227
--------

:doc:`../timtools/index` 0.6.42 released:

- The boldness of bold and normal text is now configurable for
  prnprint.py
  (see [ref NEW:492 How bold is bold? (14.04.07)]).           


20090418
--------

I discovered that :meth:`lino.textprinter.pdfprn.PdfTextPrinter.insertImage`
has changed its behaviour between `0.6.37 <20071123_>`  and 
`0.6.42 <20090227>`_.
Maybe because I upgraded the ReportLab toolkit between those releases. 

PdfTextPrinter.insertImage() does not support *behindText*.
Images are always placed over any text that occurs before them in 
the input file.


20090419 Working on tests
-------------------------

- runtests.py now recurses into subdirs.

- Started to move configuration options from "lino.config" to application-specific options. The first option is
  :configcmd:`postscript_printer`.
  Its definition has moved 
  from the obsolete global :xfile:`lino.cfg` file to a new file :xfile:`runtest.ini`.
  Until now it was accessed in testcases by::
  
    config.win32.get('postscript_printer')
    
  New access code::
  
    self.runtests.options.postscript_printer

- moved my_import and tsttools from lino.misc to lino.tools
