20071123
--------

:doc:`../timtools` 0.6.37 released


20090227
--------

:doc:`../timtools` 0.6.42 released:

- The boldness of bold and normal text is now configurable for
  prnprint.py
  (see [ref NEW:492 How bold is bold? (14.04.07)]).           


20090418
--------

I discovered that :meth:`lino.textprinter.pdfprn.PdfTextPrinter.insertImage`
has changed its behaviour between `0.6.37 <20071123>`_  and 
<0.6.42 <20090227>`_.
Maybe because I upgraded the ReportLab toolkit between those releases. 

PdfTextPrinter.insertImage() does not support *behindText*.
Images are always placed over any text that occurs before them in 
the input file.
