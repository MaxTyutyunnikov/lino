The values behind Lino
======================

In this text Luc tries to explain what Lino *really* means to him,
why he loves his work and believes that it is worth doing it.


Linked objects
--------------

"Lino" is an acronym of the words "**Lin**\ ked **o**\ bjects".

- Every software application requires a "model" of the 
  "world" (i.e. the things to be managed by the application).
  The idea of using *linked objects* for this modelization
  has been first formulated by Edgar F. Codd
  in 1969 in his `relational database model 
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model>`_.

- But even 50 years later this idea is still some kind of expert knowledge, 
  known to database engineers but not to normal people.

- Since the early 1990s I have often observed that application developers 
  seem to hide from the end-users the fact that their application is basically 
  "nothing but a collection of linked objects".
  As if they were ashamed to admit that what they are doing is *that* easy.

Lino puts an end to this vicious circle.

- Yes, a Lino application *is* that easy.
  One Lino application developer who understood this, wrote:
  "The development is so terribly easy, that one customer looked at 
  the code and started to code Layouts and modify models by 
  himself and I almost felt no developer is needed anymore :-)"

- And no, there is no reason to be ashamed.
  We continue to need professional 
  developers because the gory details require some experience, 
  and because it is an art to make the right choices on what 
  to take into account and what to ignore.
  
**Lino applications are proud to feature a transparent,
rather exhibited view of their database model,
leading to end-users being intuitively aware 
of the structure behind what they are doing.** 


Lino is a common first name in Italy
------------------------------------

Yes, I wanted **a human name** for our framework.
Lino makes it possible to write complex applications that are like 
children: they grow day by day, 
giving parental joy to those who collaborate to their development.



Reconciling developers and end-users
------------------------------------

The IT world is suffering from developers who are very competent 
but unable to communicate with end-users. 
This is where specialization becomes absurd.
The goal of any software application is to 
*transfer knowledge from a human brain to a computer and back*.
A software application makes no sense without its users.

Lino tries to remedy this and to promote peace between developers 
and end-users by breaking down walls and building bridges.

- When end-users are intuitively aware of the structure behind what 
  they are doing,
  this leads to better communication between developers and 
  end-users because **they speak the same language**. 
  (Well that's an exaggeration -- it's normal that there are certain differences 
  in vocabulary, but:) They stop to completely miss the point of what the other is talking about.

- Lino applications give their users a **feeling of being able** to 
  do it themselves.
  This motivates them to start thinking about 
  how they actually *would* do it themselves. 
  The developer then just implements what they ask, 
  no more need to translate their language or to analyze their "true needs",
  because the users understand what is possible and correctly analyze what they really need.
  A key to success and long-term satisfaction.
