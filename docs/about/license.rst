Licensing : How to make money with Lino
=======================================

Lino is published under the 
`GPL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License>`_.
What does this concretely mean for a Lino application developer?
This section explains how the author of Lino understands the GPL 
(it has no legal value, the only authority is the license text).

- This license gives you the permission to use Lino and write 
  your own Lino application.
  A Lino application can be something as simple as
  the "Polls" application described in 
  :doc:`The Polls tutorial </tutorials/polls>`.
  
- You may also write your own collection of Lino plugins,
  a concurrent to the :doc:`Lino Modules Library </topics/modlib>`.
  
- You may write some other extension to Lino, or even start a fork 
  which does certain things in a better way.
  
If you do any of the above, 
then your work is also subject to the GPL.
You are free to use it for yourself and within your company,
you may (and are encouraged to) share your work to others, 
as long as you do this according to the terms of the GPL:
no license fee, source code available etc...

You may do all this as a *commercial activity*, 
asking money for your support.

You do not need to register nor to pay me for doing so. 
Of course I recommend that you inform me about your activity and to register 
at least to the announcement mailing list.
And maybe I will offer you to pay me money for getting my professional support. 
But these are not requirements.

**If you prefer to distribute your work 
using a proprietary license,
then I equally encourage you to do so.**
The only detail in that case is that you must ask me (the author of Lino) 
for *another license than the GPL*.
Since Lino is young, you are likely to get your commercial license 
for good conditions, but you need to contact me.
