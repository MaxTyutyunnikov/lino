Licensing : How to make money with Lino
=======================================

Lino is published under the 
`GPL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License>`_.
What does this concretely mean for a Lino application developer?
This section explains how the author of Lino understands the GPL 
(it has no legal value, the only authority is the license text).

- This license gives you the permission to use Lino and write 
  your own Lino application.
  A Lino application can be something as simple as
  the "Polls" application described in 
  :doc:`The Polls tutorial </tutorials/polls>`.
  
- You may also write your own collection of Lino plugins,
  a concurrent to the :doc:`Lino Modules Library </topics/modlib>`.
  
- You may write some other extension to Lino, or even start a fork 
  which does certain things in a better way.
  
If you do any of the above, then your work is also subject to the GPL.
You are free to use it for yourself and within your company,
you may (and are encouraged to) share your work to others, 
as long as you do this according to the terms of the GPL:
no license fee, source code available etc...

You may do all this as a *commercial activity*, for example, 

- you may run your Lino application on an Internet server
  and sell subscriptions to users of your system. 
  You don't need to publish your source code in that 
  case since you are not conveying your work. Lino is GPL, not AGPL.

- Or you may publish your application without documentation, 
  maintaining your own knowledge base and selling your know-how.

You do not need to register nor to pay me for doing theses things. 
Of course I recommend that you inform me about your activity and to register 
at least to the announcement mailing list.
And maybe I will offer you to pay me money for getting my professional support. 
But these are not requirements.

It gets complicated only if you want to 
**distribute your work using a proprietary license**.
But even in that case I encourage you to do so.
It is just a question of money: 
(1) you must ask me for *another license than the GPL* 
and 
(2) I must ask for commercial licenses for certain libraries 
which Lino uses (ExtJS, Ext.ensible and maybe more)
