Licensing : How to make money with Lino
=======================================

Lino is published under the 
`GPL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License>`_.
What does this concretely mean for a Lino application developer?
This section explains how the author of Lino understands the GPL.

- If you write a Lino application, you may distribute and sell it as your work,
  using either a commercial or a free license.

  A Lino application can be something as simple as
  the "Polls" application described in 
  :doc:`The Polls tutorial </tutorials/polls>`.

- This permission is given also if your application uses some part of the 
  :doc:`Lino Modules Library </topics/modlib>`, which is a collection of built-in Lino plugins.

- You may even write and distribute 
  a commercial collection of Lino plugins,
  a concurrent to the :doc:`Lino Modules Library </topics/modlib>`.

If you do any of the above, 
you do not need to register nor to pay me for doing so. 
Of course I recommend that you inform me about your activity and to register 
at least to the announcement mailing list.
And maybe I will offer you to pay me money for getting my professional support. 
But these are not requirements.

In other words, using formulations picked from the 
`FAQ about the GNU Licenses 
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLInProprietarySystem>`_:

- Since Lino is GPL, you cannot *incorporate* Lino in a proprietary system, 
  but you can *distribute Lino alongside* your proprietary system.
- A Lino application and the Lino framework communicate 
  "at arms length", they are not "combined in a way that would 
  make them effectively a single program".
- Take care at the form how you describe what you are doing: 
  you may not deliberately hide to your customers the fact that 
  your application uses Lino.
