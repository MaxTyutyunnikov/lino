Lino and Django
---------------

When Luc discovered Django in the end of 2008, he was quickly seized by
the clear design and mature implementation. Some of his statements:
"The ORM and database model based on *applications* is simply genial.
The way of how this is integrated into a web application server system: genial.
But one thing disturbed me: the 
`admin application <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#ref-contrib-admin>`_  
has obviously not been designed to write complete database applications.
That's why I started to write Lino.
Lino is an alternative for Django's `django.contrib.admin` module."

Unlike a Django application developer, 
a Lino application developer doesn't write a single 
line of HTML, CSS or Javascript.
