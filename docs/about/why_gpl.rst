Why GPL?
========

Yes, I principally publish my work under the `GPL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License>`_

The BSD versus GPL discussion has a "religious" dimension.  The personal preference of a software developer seems to depend mainly on his or her life situation and beliefs. And as far as I can see, my personal faith is clear: the GPL is the only license that `"resists proprietary  vendors' attempts to embrace, extend and extinguish <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish>`_".

I don't claim to understand the topic completely, so I'm open to comments and discussion, and maybe I'll even change my mind. One reason to make me change my mind might be if I hear that people who would otherwise collaborate on Lino, refrain from doing so because of the GPL licensing. Let me know if you are one of them. On the other hand, here are some thoughts of other developers against the GPL that *didn't* make me change my mind:

* "I do not wish to pay for my javascript framework, nor do I want 
  to be forced to GPL it, as is the only other option available 
  to me if I use ExtJS." 
  (`coderseye.com 2008-06-04 <http://coderseye.com/2008/why-i-didnt-switch-from-jquery-to-extjs-after-all.html>`_) 
  
  (My answer: Yes, that's why I like the GPL: it forces users of my work 
  to give back to the public common. A public common that allows people to take 
  without giving back cannot be sustainable.)
  
* "I do not wish (...) to show some of the ugly code I play around with on “playground/testing” sites." 
  (`coderseye.com 2008-06-04 <http://coderseye.com/2008/why-i-didnt-switch-from-jquery-to-extjs-after-all.html>`_) 
  
  (My answer: Don't worry, you wouldn't be the only one who publishes 
  shamelessly ugly code. Just look at my code. 
  The GPL dosn't require you to write beautiful code.)
