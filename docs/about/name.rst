About the name "Lino"
=====================

Lino is an Italian forename
whose most famous bearer was probably
`Lino Ventura
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lino_Ventura>`_.

Native English speakers should pronounce it as "Leeno".

"Lino" is also an acronym of the words "**Lin**\ ked **o**\ bjects".
Read more about this in :doc:`/about/values`.

Note that Lino the framework has nothing to do with the 
`German company of same name <http://www.lino.de>`_.
We congratulate that company for having chosen such a beautiful name, 
we don't feel disturbed by them and hope that they don't do so either.
Lino (the framework) is a free software project 
:doc:`licensed under the terms of the GPL <why_gpl>`, 
so you cannot buy it, and thus we do not have
any motivation to register a trademark or to prevent others from 
using that beautiful name.
