GPL or BSD?
-----------

Yes, I principally publish my work under the 
`GPL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License>`_.

The BSD versus GPL discussion has evolved to an almost religious
dimension.  The personal preference of a software developer seems to
depend mainly on his or her life situation and beliefs. And as far as I
can see, my personal faith is clear: the GPL is the only license that
"resists proprietary vendors' attempts to `embrace, extend and extinguish 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish>`__"
(a formualtion I found on `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License>`__).

This said, I want to add that I'm open to comments, critics and
discussion, and maybe I'll even change my mind, because I don't claim to
understand the topic completely.

One reason to make me change my mind might be if I hear that people who
would otherwise collaborate on Lino, refrain from doing so because of
the GPL licensing. Let me know if you are one of them.
