=============
What is Lino?
=============

Lino is a collection of Python modules maintained by Luc Saffre.
Luc is the developer of `TIM <http://tim.saffre-rumma.ee/>`_, a framework for database business applications 
in small and medium-sized organisations, and his long-term vision is to 
write a successor for TIM.

Lino is the common code repository for two relatively non-related
packages:

========================= ==========================================
:doc:`../timtools/index`  A selection of command-line tools for TIM
                          users.
:doc:`../django/index`    A framework to write Django applications.
