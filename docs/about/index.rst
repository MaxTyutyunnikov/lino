About Lino
==========

A Lino application is technically just a Django project, 
but the application developer does not need to write any 
URLconf, HTML nor CSS.
This is because unlike Django, 
Lino provides an out-of-the box user interface. 

 
When Luc discovered Django in the end of 2008, after having worked 
many months on his own database model, he was quickly fascinated.
A little bit later he wrote:
"The ORM and database model based on 'apps' is simply genial.
The way of how this is integrated into a web application server system: genial.
But one thing disturbed me: the 
`admin application <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#ref-contrib-admin>`_  
has obviously not been designed to write complete database applications.
That's why I started to write Lino.
Lino is an alternative for Django's `django.contrib.admin` module."

The decision of *not using* some part of an established framework 
of course needs some audacity, foolishness, self-confidence or however 
you might call it (:doc:`more <lino_and_django>`).


Features
--------
    
Because Lino applications are Django projects, 
the following features (copied from the 
`Django website <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_) 
also apply to Lino:

- **Object-relational mapper** :
  Define your data models entirely in Python. 
  You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free -- 
  but you can still write SQL if needed.
  
- **Internationalization** :
  Django has full support for multi-language applications, 
  letting you specify translation strings and providing 
  hooks for language-specific functionality.  

- **Cache system** :
  Hook into memcached or other cache frameworks for super performance 
  -- caching is as granular as you need.
  
Lino then adds its own features to the above:

- :doc:`/topics/layouts` :  
  Design not only your *models* but also your *forms* using the Python language.
  
- An extensible collection of out-of-the-box :doc:`user interfaces </topics/ui>`.
  Lino application developers don't waste their time writing html templates or css.

- :ref:`mldbc` : 
  Use Lino's rich experience with applications that manage 
  multilingual database content.
  
- Use Lino's tools for generating :ref:`userdocs`.
  
- Lino includes :ref:`dpy`, 
  a great alternative to `South <http://south.aeracode.org/>`_
  to manage your :ref:`database migrations <datamig>`.
  
- **Other features** include extensions to handle
  :ref:`polymorphism`, 
  :doc:`/topics/perms` 
  and 
  :doc:`/topics/workflow`.
  


Components
----------

Lino consists of different parts which are currently in a single 
project, but that might change in the future:

- the framework itself. See :mod:`lino.dd` for an overview
  of the concepts.

- a collection of *user interface renderers*.
  Currently there's one for ExtJS 
  and another for a Twitter/Bootstrap-based "plain" interface.

- a collection of reusable Django apps and out-of-the-box 
  demo applications



Design goals
------------

- Lino applications are intuitive and easy-to-understand for the end user.
  (Context menus, Tooltips,...)
- agile programming
- rapid prototyping 
- libraries of reusable code
- short release cycles
- maintainable code
- stable 


History
-------

Luc Saffre, the author of Lino, is also the author of :term:`TIM`, 
a DOS-based framework for writing database applications for small enterprises. 
Lino is a successor for TIM.
TIM is over 15 years old, but Luc continues to live from maintaining 
it and giving professional support to its users. 
TIM users have relatively wide-spread profiles, 
ranging from the independant craftsman who writes 50 invoices per year 
to the government agency with 30 users and hundreds of documents per day.

Luc has been working on writing a successor for TIM **since the early 1990s**.
He has done and dropped projects in C++, PHP and Java. 
Since **August 2004** he's mostly working in Python. 
In **March 2009** he discovered :term:`Django` whose database model and application 
server concepts seem ideal for Lino. 
In **August 2009** he started to use the :term:`ExtJS` Javascript framework.

The first real-world Lino application started 
in a Belgian *Public Centre for Social Welfare* 
(PCSW) in **January 2011**.
In **August 2012** we forked it into a separate project 
`Lino-Welfare <http://welfare.lino-framework.org>`_
to be maintained by an independant organization.

In September 2012 we purchased the domain name `lino-framework.org`.

In December 2012 we 
`announced 
<http://blog.lino-framework.org/2012/12/belgian-accounting-made-simple.html>`_
a first prototype of `Lino Cos√¨`.
