About Lino
==========

I am the author of `TIM <http://code.google.com/p/tim/>`_, 
a DOS-based framework to write database applications for small enterprises. 
TIM is over 15 years old, and I live from maintaining it and giving support to its users.

I've been dreaming about a successor for TIM for over ten years.
Since August 2004 I'm doing this using Python.
In March 2009 I decided to drop some important parts of Lino because Django did this job much better than what I had written so far.
