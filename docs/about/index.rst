Features
--------
    
Lino applications are, technically speaking, normal Django 
projects, so the following features (copied from the 
`Django website <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_) 
also apply to Lino:

- **Object-relational mapper** :
  Define your data models entirely in Python. 
  You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free -- 
  but you can still write SQL if needed.
  
- **Internationalization** :
  Django has full support for multi-language applications, 
  letting you specify translation strings and providing 
  hooks for language-specific functionality.  

- **Cache system** :
  Hook into memcached or other cache frameworks for super performance 
  -- caching is as granular as you need.
  
Lino then adds its own features to the above:

- An extensible collection of out-of-the-box :doc:`user interfaces </topics/ui>`.
  Lino application developers don't waste their time writing html templates or css.

- :doc:`/topics/layouts` :  
  Design not only your models but also your forms using the Python language.
  
- :doc:`/topics/babel` : 
  Use Lino's rich experience with applications that manage 
  multilingual database content.
  
- :doc:`/topics/datamig` :
  Optionally use Lino's great alternative to 
  `South <http://south.aeracode.org/>`_
  to manage your database migrations.
  
- **Other features** include extensions to handle
  :doc:`Polymorphism </topics/mti>`, 
  :doc:`/topics/perms` 
  and 
  :doc:`/topics/workflow`.


Design goals
------------

- Lino applications are intuitive and easy-to-understand for the end user.
  (Context menus, Tooltips,...)
- agile programming
- rapid prototyping 
- libraries of reusable code
- short release cycles
- maintainable code
- stable 


History
-------

Luc Saffre, the author of Lino, is also the author of :term:`TIM`, 
a DOS-based framework for writing database applications for small enterprises. 
Lino is a successor for TIM.
TIM is over 15 years old, but Luc continues to live from maintaining 
it and giving professional support to its users. 
TIM users have relatively wide-spread profiles, 
ranging from the independant craftsman who writes 50 invoices per year 
to the government agency with 30 users and hundreds of documents per day.

Luc has been working on writing a successor for TIM **since the early 1990s**.
He has done and dropped projects in C++, PHP and Java. 
Since **August 2004** he's mostly working in Python. 
In **March 2009** he discovered :term:`Django` whose database model and application 
server concepts seem ideal for Lino. 
In **August 2009** he started to use the :term:`ExtJS` Javascript framework.

The first real-world Lino application started 
in a Belgian *Public Centre for Social Welfare* 
(PCSW) in **January 2011**.
In **August 2012** we forked it into a separate project 
`Lino-Welfare <http://welfare.lino-framework.org>`_
to be maintained by an independant organization.

In September 2012 we purchased the domain name `lino-framework.org`.

In December 2012 we 
`announced 
<http://blog.lino-framework.org/2012/12/belgian-accounting-made-simple.html>`_
a first prototype of `Lino Cos√¨`.
