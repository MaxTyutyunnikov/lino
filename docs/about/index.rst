About Lino
==========

What is Lino?
-------------

Lino is a framework for writing enterprise-level database applications, 
using a combination of 
:term:`Django` (application server and database model)
and :term:`ExtJS` (user interface). 

About the author
----------------

I am the author of :term:`TIM`, 
a DOS-based framework to write database applications for small enterprises. 
TIM is over 15 years old, and I live from maintaining it and giving support to its users.

I've been dreaming about a successor for TIM for over ten years.
Since August 2004 I'm doing this using Python.

In March 2009 I discovered :term:`Django` and decided to drop `lino.adamo` because Django did this job much better than what I had written so far.
