About Lino
==========

Lino is a framework for writing enterprise-level database applications, 
using :term:`Django's <Django>` database model and application server behind the scenes,
and the :term:`ExtJS` Javascript library to provide a modern user interface.

Lino has no users yet, but we are currently working on getting it started on a site in Belgium. We hope for success until the end of 2010.

Luc Saffre, the author of Lino, is also the author of :term:`TIM`, 
a DOS-based framework for writing database applications for small enterprises. TIM is over 15 years old, but Luc lives from maintaining it and giving support to its users. 
TIM users have relatively wide-spread profiles, ranging from the independant craftsman who writes 50 invoices per year to the government agency with 30 users and hundreds of documents per day.

Luc has been working on writing a successor for TIM since the early 1990s. He has done and dropped projects in C++, PHP and Java. Since August 2004 he's doing this using Python. In March 2009 he discovered :term:`Django` whose database model and application server concepts seem ideal for Lino. In August 2009 he started to use the ExtJS Javascript framework.
