============================
How to get started with Lino
============================

The "visible" part of Lino is a collection
of standalone `scripts <scripts.html>`_.

Currently I can only give the following instructions:

- `Install Lino <install.html>`_
- run the test suites
- look at the source code.

You can also skip installation an `browse the CVS repository
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/lino/>`_ to have a
look at the code.
  

The source distribution has the following main subdirectories

- tests : test suites. Currently the best place to start.

- src : the Python source files.

- docs : documentation.
  Currently this contains the same as the homepage.
