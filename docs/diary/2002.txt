Lino Diary 2002
===============

20021127 [timtools]

- possibility to specify the name of output file
- parses now the command line using getopt

20021130 [timtools]

- renamed the whole project to "TIM Tools".
  prn2pdf is now a part of TIM Tools.
  Another (new) TIM Tool in this suite is sendmail


20021208 [timtools]

How I use McMillan installer to create the binary distribution:

- Created a spec file for every tool, using::
  python s:\installer\Makespec.py prn2pdf.py
  python s:\installer\Makespec.py sendmail.py
  
- Modified the `*.spec` files to specify the same temporary dist
  directory::
  
    coll = COLLECT( exe,
                    a.binaries,
                    strip=0,
                    name=r'c:\temp\dist\timtools')
                    
- mkdist.bat runs McMillan installer and creates the zip files on my
  homepage.

20021209 [timtools]

- Published a relatively stable release. Both prn2pdf and sendmail work
  well, at least for me and my customers. Hopefully.


20021219

- renamed t:/data/luc/lino/python to t:/data/luc/lino/src
- renamed src/test to src/tests

20021221

- moved QueryRow to dbd.abstract.py
- A Table on its own cannot create Rows. You need a Cursor for that.


20021222

- Query should one day be renamed to View. But not yet.

- Columns are now instanciated in the cursor. The Query just stores
  the column names.
  
- Component.GetColumn() ersetzt durch ein if isinstance() in
  cursor.py. Denn table.py soll cursor.py nicht kennen.
  
- Table.expr2row(expr) muss jetzt die Row als Parameter mit bekommen.



20021227 [timtools]

- added ftpsync.py which was an early study before I asked this
  question in comp.lang.python where Carl Banks wrote:

  my ftpsync.py will probably vanish since I just need to adapt Carl's
  ftpupsync.py to work on Windows.

- added publish.py which I used until now under the name
  renlower.py. "renlower" was no longer accurate name since it now
  also creates thumbnails.
  Here is the CHANGES string from renlower.py::
  
    20021218

    - did not show the complete file names (only without path) for
      confirmation

    20021225  
    - directory names were not renamed
    - added thumbnail creation

    20021227
    - rename had a bug since 20021225
