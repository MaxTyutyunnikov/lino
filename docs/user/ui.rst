UI renderer
===========

Lino has an extensible set of user interfaces (UIs). 
This means that you may access your Lino application in different ways.
Currently there is only one fully functional UI called 
the :ref:`lino.ui.extjs`.

But also the :ref:`lino.ui.plain` can be useful. 
You can currently see it in action by clicking the "HTML" button 
of a :ref:`lino.ui.grid`

.. _lino.ui.extjs:

ExtJS UI
--------

.. _lino.ui.plain:

Plain UI
--------

A "plain" HTML render that uses bootstrap and jQuery.
It is called "plain" because it's much more lightweight 
than the :ref:`lino.ui.extjs`.
