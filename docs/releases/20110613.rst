Revision `4bf5a5344714 <http://code.google.com/p/lino/source/detail?r=4bf5a53447140dc9d9deb14c636451de8f98ef43>`_
Another small release with a few optimizations of the user interface.

Visible changes
---------------

- Disabled slave elements in Insert Window
- Intuitiveres Bearbeiten der Drittpartner
- Some more translations (fr and de)

See :doc:`/blog/2011/0613`


New features
------------

- Lino applications can now be located somewhere else than on "/".


Upgrade instructions
--------------------

- In your local :xfile:`settings.py`, find the line::

    LINO = Lino(__file__)
    
  and change it to::
  
    LINO = Lino(__file__,globals())
    
  The result is that Lino will also adapt the 
  settings FIXTURE_DIRS, MEDIA_ROOT and TEMPLATE_DIRS for you.
  If your :xfile:`settings.py` later sets these variables, 
  should should now uncomment these lines, too. 



For more general instructions on how to upgrade an existing 
Lino site, see :doc:`/admin/upgrade`.

No database migration needed.
