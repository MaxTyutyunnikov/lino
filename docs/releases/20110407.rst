The following are technical instructions related to this

For more general instructions on how to upgrade an existing 
Lino site, see :doc:`/admin/upgrade`).

- Database migration needed because the `User` model is now 
  really from :mod:`lino.modlib.users` and no longer 
  (partly) from django.contrib.auth
  tablename is now `users_user` instead of `auth_user`, and there's no password field anymore.
