Demo sites
==========

.. note::

  The demos are slow:
  Lino demos are currently available on only one server, 
  located in Estonia behind a slow Internet connection. 
  We are looking forward to Internet host providers 
  who agree to host a Lino demo on their server.
  Note also that :term:`ExtJS` has performance problems when using Firefox with FireBug enabled.
  We currently recommend Google Chrome for being the fastest browser.


You can log into the demo sites listed below using one of the following user names:

  ======== ========
  username password
  ======== ========
  `root`   `1234`
  `user`   `1234`
  ======== ========

Be prepared to see things not working as expected. 
Don't hesitate to contact us if you have questions, comments, ideas, suggestions.

You may change data, and your changes will remain visible to others until the next release.

All person names and addresses appearing on the demo sites
