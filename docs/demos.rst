Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.

**The demos are slow**:
Demos are currently available on only one server, located in Estonia behind a slow Internet connection. 
Note also that :term:`ExtJS` has performance problems when using Firefox with FireBug enabled.
We currently recommend Google Chrome for being the fastest browser.
So don't expect too much performance. 
We are looking forward to other people who agree to provide a Lino demo on their server.
