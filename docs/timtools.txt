TIM tools
=========

The TIM Tools are a suite of command-line tools designed as helpers
for existing DOS applications.  I wrote them originally for use with
`TIM <http://my.tele2.ee/lsaffre/tim>`_.  They are used by some of my
customers.

TIM users use the TIM Tools to:

- print classical text-mode reports on printers without text support.

- let TIM print business documents as PDF files

- invoke the user's Web browser to visit a Web site of a business
  partner.

- invoke the user's mail client with a TIM-generated business document
  to be sent to a partner.  

  
Installing TIM Tools
====================

- Download the file `timtools-VER-.zip` from `here
  <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=87016&release_id=203525>`_.

- Unpack the zip file to a separate directory in your PATH.

Technically the TIM Tools are just an easy-to-install binary release
with a selection of Lino `scripts <scripts.html>`_, implemented as
Win32 executables.
