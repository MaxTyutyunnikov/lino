Generating documents
====================

This page is to collect my thoughts about an old topic: I have a database application written in Python, and I would like to generate printable documents which the user can customize by editing templates.

- Templates can be (depending on my customer's whish) in one of the following formats:

  - OpenOffice.org
  - HTML
  - LaTeX
  - Microsoft Rich Text Format
  
  

Processors:

- Django templates
- `xhtml2pdf <http://www.xhtml2pdf.com/>`_
- `appy/pod <http://appyframework.org/pod.html>`_
- `wkhtmltopdf <http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf>`_
