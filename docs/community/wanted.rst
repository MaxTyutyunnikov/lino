Wanted: Lino Application Developer
==================================

Work independently to write your own 
Rich Internet Application using 
`Lino <http://www.lino-framework.org>`__, 
a young framework that combines 
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__
and 
`ExtJS <http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`__.
Get free support by the author 
and free hosting space for your startup company.

Earn money by selling support for your application to your customers.
Your primary customers are agencies and companies who 
need a customized database application 
"more than MS-Access for cheaper than SAP".
See also :doc:`/about/license`.

We do not currently offer paid jobs,
(except for one :doc:`limited special offer <wanted-sysadmin>`)
but there is hope that this will change in the near future. 
*Show your interest now to be a privileged
