Community
=========

Lino lives currently from personal enthusiasm of a few people, 
but we hope that the community will grew soon.
This is the time for pionieers to join us!

Lino is :doc:`published under the GPL </about/why_gpl>` 
because we want to make sure that our voluntary work will always 
belong to the general public and never be misused 
by some proprietary organisation.


Here are some profiles of people we would happily welcome:


Developers

  Check our list of :doc:`/tickets/index` and see whether you'd like to help 
  with one of these. 
  **If you have some Python experience** and are willing to 
  **invest a week of your life** to check out 
  whether you and this project fit together, 
  then contact me and get a **free one-week holiday** 
  with the author and his family in `Vigala (Estonia) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigala_Parish>`_!
  

Advisors

  Follow what's going on, meet or chat with us and say your opinion about Lino.
  
Testers

  Get a Lino snapshot running on your site and tell us 
  what needs to be done.

Translators
  
  Translate gettext catalogs into your own language using either your preferred plain text editor or a tool like 
  `Poedit <http://www.poedit.net>`_.
  gettext catalogs (aka ".po files") are chunks of English text as they appear in Lino.



You might also want to subscribe to 
`lino-discuss <http://groups.google.com/group/lino-discuss>`_, 
our mailing list for general discussion 
about milestones, priorities, deadlines etc.
