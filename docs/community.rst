Community
=========

Lino lives currently from personal enthusiasm of a few people, 
but we hope that the community will grew soon.
This is the time for pionieers to join us!

Lino is :doc:`published under the GPL </about/why_gpl>` 
because we want to make sure that our voluntary work will always 
belong to the general public and never be misused 
by some proprietary organisation.
