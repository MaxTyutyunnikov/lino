Community
=========

Lino lives currently from personal enthusiasm of a few people, 
but we hope that the community will grew soon.
This is the time for pionieers to join us!

Lino is :doc:`published under the GPL </about/why_gpl>` 
because we want to make sure that our voluntary work will always 
belong to the general public and never be misused 
by some proprietary organisation.

As a first step we suggest you to subscribe to 
`lino-discuss <http://groups.google.com/group/lino-discuss>`_, 
our mailing list for general discussion 
about milestones, priorities, deadlines etc. 


Here are some profiles of people we would happily welcome:

Advisors

  Follow what's going on, meet or chat with us and say your opinion about Lino.
  
Testers

  Get a Lino snapshot running on your site and tell us 
  what needs to be done.

Translators
  
  Translate gettext catalogs into your own language using either your preferred plain text editor or a tool like 
  `Poedit <http://www.poedit.net>`_.
  gettext catalogs (aka ".po files") are chunks of English text as they appear in Lino.

Developers

  Check our list of :doc:`/tickets/index` and see whether you'd like to help with one of these.
