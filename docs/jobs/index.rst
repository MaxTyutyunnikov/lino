**About us**

- *Rumma & Ko OÃœ* is a small company in Estonia whose mission is to act as 
  patron for independently working developers of free software. 
  We believe that writing good software is an *art* and that software 
  developers should work and get paid like *artists*.
  
- Our senior software artist is *Luc Saffre*, 
  author of the stable and venerable flagship 
  `TIM <https://code.google.com/p/tim/>`_
  and it's successor *Lino*.

- Since 2009 we are investing most of our energy into Lino.
  We know that Lino is genial.
  We also know that there is some work to do before this becomes evident.
  And that's no problem for us because anyway we prefer sustainable growth 
  over rapid revenue.

**Conditions**
  
- You remain independant. We are not employing you, 
  you just send us a monthly invoice and we pay it.
  And every now and then we both evaluate
  whether or not we want to continue our partnership. 
  
- You and Luc reserve a weekly time (about 30 minutes) to talk 
  about what's up, using some voice channel.
  
- We make a long-term agreement based on an estimated average workload.
  You send us a weekly report about what you have been doing.
  We don't waste time to discuss about every hour.
  Creative work is priceless. 
  Time is not always money.
