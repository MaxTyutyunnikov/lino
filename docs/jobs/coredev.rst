Lino core developer
===================

Work independently from home as assistant core developer 
of the `Lino framework <http://lino-framework.org>`__.

**Requirements**

If you...

- love the Python programming language
- have read the :doc:`/tutorials/index`
  and were not completely lost
- have been following 
  :doc:`Luc's blog </blog/2013/index>`
  for some time and feel able to help him with his work.
  
... then read on!  

**Rumma & Ko OÃœ** is a small company in Estonia whose mission is to act as 
patron for independently working developers of free software. 
We believe that writing good software is an *art* and that software 
developers should work and get paid like *artists*.

Our senior software artist is **Luc Saffre**, 
author of the stable and venerable flagship 
`TIM <https://code.google.com/p/tim/>`_
and it's successor **Lino**.

Since 2009 we are investing most of our energy into Lino.
We know that Lino is genial.
We also know that there is much work to do before the world can see this.
But that's no problem because we 
prefer sustainable growth over rapid revenue.

**Conditions**
  
- You remain independant. We are not employing you, 
  you just send us a monthly invoice and we pay it.
  And every now and then we both evaluate
  whether or not we want to continue our partnership. 
  
- You and Luc reservate both a weekly time (about 30 minutes) to talk 
  about what's up, using some voice channel.
  
- We make a long-term agreement based on an estimated average workload.
  You send us a weekly report about what you have been doing.
  We don't waste time to discuss about every hour.
  Creative work is priceless. 
  Time is not always money.
