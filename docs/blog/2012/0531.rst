:mod:`lino.modlib.cbss.fixtures.inscodes` didn't work on existing data 
that had no French country names. 
Now it is based on a dictionary ISO code to the corresponding 
code of the Belgian "Institut National de Statistique".

:class:`lino.modlib.cbss.models.IdentifyPersonResult` now includes address and 
other fields that were still missing.
And the `Default.odt` now produces a printed result that seems usable.
