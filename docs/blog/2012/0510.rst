========

Installing Lino on a dreamhost.com account.

The `welcome.html` template isn't used anymore but was still parsed. Fixed.

In `django.core.management.__init__.py` there's a function `get_commands()`::

    global _commands
    if _commands is None:
        _commands = dict([(name, 'django.core') for name in find_commands(__path__[0])])

        # Find the installed apps
        try:
            from django.conf import settings
            apps = settings.INSTALLED_APPS
        except (AttributeError, EnvironmentError, ImportError):
            raise # <<-- add this to correct Django's behaviour
            apps = []


Django features a very strange behaviour of silently ignoring 
any `(AttributeError, EnvironmentError, ImportError)` 
that occurs during initialization.
I ignore why they did this, but it has at least one side effect: 
if the logger config (the function defined in :setting:`LOGGING`) 
tries and fails to create a logfile, then it raises an `IOError` 
(a subclass of EnvironmentError).
And you get no error message at all.
`manage.py validate` reports "0 errors", 
but nothing works because not all :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` 
have been loaded.
