========

- 1.4.9. had still a bug: when the disable_delete method of 
  households.Household, courses.CourseProvider and jobs.JobProvider 
  didn't yet correctly skip the :meth:`lino.Lino.is_imported_partner` 
  test. 
  Very subtle, but it caused watch_tim to fail when trying to 
  re-convert the two Companies that had become Households.

Don't want to cancel release 1.4.9 because it has been downloaded 
over 40 times (probably just some robots, but anyway).
So a quick bugfix release 

About version numbering.

Add new globale variable :attr:`lino.__release__` and call it 
1.4.9.2 instead?
