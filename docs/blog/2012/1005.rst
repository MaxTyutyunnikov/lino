========

- Finished recovering from the surgery.

- Unified the appearence of "action buttons". They are now always
  [between square brackets], and we might display them more button-like 
  using css if we had time to play.
  
- Fixed a problem in :mod:`lino.mixins.uploadable`:
  Certain Python versions or systems don't manage non-ascii filenames,
  so we replace any non-ascii char by "_"
