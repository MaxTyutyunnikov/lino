========

- New method :meth:`lino.Lino.get_application_info`.

- Fixed a bug that caused the list of models in `lino.About` 
  to not open in a separate window.
  :meth:`lino.core.actors.Actor.disabled_actions` returns now 
  an empty dict, but is overridden by
  :meth:`lino.core.dbtables.Table.disabled_actions`
  which tests for `get_row_permission`.
  
- Added an argument `ar` to 
  :meth:`lino.core.model.Model.disable_delete`
  and
  :func:`lino.utils.mti.delete_child`,
  because :term:`watch_tim` 
  needs special permission to modify imported partners.
  It got a "Cannot delete companies and persons imported from TIM" 
  veto when trying to convert a Person to a Company or vice-versa.

  Application code before::

      def disable_delete(self):
          if settings.LINO.is_imported_partner(self):
              return _("Cannot delete companies and persons imported from TIM")
          return super(CpasPartner,self).disable_delete()
          
  ... and after::        
          
      def disable_delete(self,ar):
          if ar is not None and settings.LINO.is_imported_partner(self):
              return _("Cannot delete companies and persons imported from TIM")
          return super(CpasPartner,self).disable_delete(ar)
