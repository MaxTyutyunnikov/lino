========

- New method :meth:`lino.Lino.get_application_info`.

- Fixed a bug that caused the list of models in `lino.About` 
  to not open in a separate window.
  :meth:`lino.core.actors.Actor.disabled_actions` returns now 
  an empty dict, but is overridden by
  :meth:`lino.core.dbtables.Table.disabled_actions`
  which tests for `get_row_permission`.
