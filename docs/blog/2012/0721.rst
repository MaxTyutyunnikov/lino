- `on_user_change` and `after_ui_save` are two solutions 
  for the same problem. Can replace `after_ui_save` 
  with `on_user_change`, but `on_user_change` should receive 
  the complete `ar`, not only the web request.


--> Replaced `on_user_change` by new method 
:meth:`lino.core.modeltools.Model.before_ui_save`.
And we now call it from 
:meth:`lino.ui.extjs3.ext_ui.ExtUI.form2obj_and_save`
and no longer from :mod:`lino.utils.dblogger` 
(who is responsible just for logging:
e.g. it is also used by :term:`watch_tim` 
which cannot be considered as a user change).



- Bugfix: Calling "Act as..." from the Calendar Panel doesn't work.

Caused a "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no 
method 'set_base_param'" in JS console.


Calendar workflow
-----------------

Event state "suggested" now means that your colleague has 
fixed a rendez-vous in your name with a client,
the client is informed and 
you must confirm that the date/time suits you.
If it doesn't, *you* are responsible for contacting 
the client and finding a new date/time.
