- `on_user_change` and `after_ui_save` are two solutions 
  for the same problem. Can replace `after_ui_save` 
  with `on_user_change`, but `on_user_change` should receive 
  the complete `ar`, not only the web request.


--> Replaced `on_user_change` by new method 
:meth:`lino.core.modeltools.Model.before_ui_save`.
And we now call it from 
:meth:`lino.ui.extjs3.ext_ui.ExtUI.form2obj_and_save`
and no longer from :mod:`lino.utils.dblogger` 
(who is responsible just for logging:
e.g. it is also used by :term:`watch_tim` 
which cannot be considered as a user change).



- Bugfix: Calling "Act as..." from the Calendar Panel doesn't work.

Caused a "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no 
method 'set_base_param'" in JS console.


Calendar workflow
-----------------

Event state "suggested" now means that your colleague has 
fixed a rendez-vous in your name with a client,
the client is informed and 
you must confirm that the date/time suits you.
If it doesn't, *you* are responsible for contacting 
the client and finding a new date/time.


Writing end-user documentation
------------------------------

I started a user documentation page for the calendar module:
:doc:`/pcsw/calendrier`.
But this page obviously is another example of why you should not 
ask the developer of a framework to write end-user documentation 
for one of the applications developed using that framework.

I got stuck when I had the feeling that now I should add some screenshots,
and I wanted them to be in French, of course.
Instead of screenshots, Lino has now a series of subtle 
optimizations and bugfixes which are useful only in 
multilingual sites:

Automatic events and tasks are now generated in the user's language.
cal.PanelCalendars now returns calendar descriptions in the user's language.
Users now inherit the language of their partner (if they have one).
The messages in :xfile:`linolib.js` hadn't been extracted during the last 5 months.

Or a funny little problems like with this 
excerpt from :srcref:`/lino/ui/extjs3/linolib.js`::

    config.bbar = config.bbar.concat([
      '->',
      { text: '[$_("Help Text Editor")]',
        handler: Lino.help_text_editor,
        qtip: "$_('Edit help texts for fields on this model.')",
        scope: this}
    ])

(And the French for "Help Text Editor" is "Editeur textes d'aide". 
Do you guess why there was a Javascript syntax error after translating?)

Some bugs are not yet fixed:

- Event.summary_row generates the following link 
  which is supposed to open the detail window on that event::

    javascript:Lino.cal.Events.detail_action.run({ "record_id": 238 })
  
  But normal users don't have `Lino.cal.Events` (seeing all Events 
  at once is reserved to managers). Lino should link to the detail action
  of EventsByPerson for example. But how to do this without too much 
  work for the API developer? To be meditated.

- Buttons "Save" and "Delete" are displayed in German also for French users.
