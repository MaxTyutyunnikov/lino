========

Restarted work on BCSS connection:

- :class:`lino.modlib.bcss.models.IdentifyPersonRequest` now inherits 
  from :class:`lino.modlib.contacts.models.PersonMixin` and stores these 
  fields on its own. Because otherwise it made no sense.
  
- Discovered and fixed a fundamental design bug in :mod:`lino.utils.xmlgen`.
  It starts now to become possible for a human to "translate" an XSD into 
  a set of xmlgen Python classes.
  
  Adapted :mod:`lino.utils.bcss` to these changes.
