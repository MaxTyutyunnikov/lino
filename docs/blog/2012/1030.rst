The "releasing" mode
--------------------

Lino-Welfare 1.0 and Lino 1.5.0 are almost released: 
they have started their service on a production site. 

Before doing the official release we remain in "releasing 
mode": the production site is running on the development 
version so that we can add quick bugfixes.

Since there is currently only one production user,
the "releasing mode" can remain active until
we need a database migration.

A first bugfix is the following::
