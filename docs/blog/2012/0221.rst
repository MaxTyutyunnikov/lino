Got Jana having the Lino version configured per project.
Worked on :doc:`/admin/install_debian`.

SiteConfigs didn't have `hide_top_toolbar=True`.
Title of a Detail Window on a table with `hide_top_toolbar=True` 
no longer includes the table's title.
Same for New and Delete buttons.

Tried to put together SiteConfigs and About, 
but understood that they are different.
About should never show a "save" button...

JobsOverview had some bugs:

- there was no refresh button
- didn't correctly check for parameter values.

And another bug:
quicklink "Detail" muss hei√üen "Detail Personen".
Das kam, weil ShowDetail ja jetzt eine RowAction ist.

Oops, there were meanwhile 88 downloads of the 1.4.0 
tarball on :term:`PyPI`, so I should rather not touch these 
files and create a new version instead:
:doc:`/releases/1.4.1`.

But a remark to those who downloaded Lino recently: 
give us some feedback: 
Why did you download it? 
What did you expect?
