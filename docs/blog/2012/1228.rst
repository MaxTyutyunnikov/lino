Lino and content management
---------------------------

During the Christmas days I learned a lot about 
the `Bootstrap CSS toolkit <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`__.

Before:

  :scale: 50
  
After:  

.. image:: 1228b.jpg
  :scale: 50


And these pictures are only the tip of the iceberg: 
I think I finally found a working solution for 
:mod:`lino.modlib.pages`
and :mod:`lino.apps.cms`.
But it's too early to write more about it.


Cannot assign "u''": "Event.assigned_to" must be a "User" instance
------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating an event in the Calendar Panel in 
http://demo2.lino-framework.org
caused a ValueError at /admin/restful/cal/PanelEvents:
"Cannot assign "u''": "Event.assigned_to" must be a "User" instance."
This was a plain simple bug.
