Ta-daa! The long awaited calendar panel finally works! 
Users can create, move resize and delete events using 
the calendar panel.

The Ta-daa doesn't apply to the following limitations which 
we'll tackle when need arises:

- managing recurrent events
- displaying also tasks in the calendar panel

As expected, it was all just a fiddling with the gory details of 
AJAX communication between Lino and the Ext.ensible CalendarPanel.

Each :class:`StoreField <lino.ui.extjs3.ext_store.StoreField>` 
now has a `name` attribute.

:func:`py2js <lino.utils.jsgen.py2js>`
and 
the `Ext.ensible.cal.EventMappings` defined in :xfile:`:linolib.js`
now use the 
new Lino configuration settings
:attr:`lino.Lino.datetime_format_strftime`,
:attr:`lino.Lino.datetime_format_extjs`
and
:meth:`lino.Lino.parse_datetime`.

Note that there are now three times three settings to handle 
date and time values!

- X_format_extjs
- X_format_strftime
- parse_X

for X being date, time and datetime.

datetime is not simply a combination of date and time:
time fields contain (in a default configuration) 
only minutes, while datetime fields have also seconds.
