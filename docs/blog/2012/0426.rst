========

Started working on :doc:`/tickets/62`.

Preliminary studies using :mod:`lino.apps.min1`.
I wanted to make it a really minimal application by also removing 
:mod:`lino.modlib.users` and 
`django.contrib.contenttypes`
The former is now done, 
but the latter is still needed because for a very stupid reason:
Django's `loaddata` command doesn't allow empty fixtures.
Posted a `feature request 
<https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/18213>`_.

En attendant, Lino now at least issues a helpful error message 
explaining the true reason:

  Exception: Fixture t:\hgwork\lino\lino\fixtures\std.py decided to not create any object.
  We're sorry, but Django doesn't like that.
  See <https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/18213>.
