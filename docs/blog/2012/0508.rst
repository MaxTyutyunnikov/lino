CBSS connection
---------------

After having fiddled and fought with `lino.utils.xmlgen`, `lxml` and `elementtree`, 
there is now hope that I now finally found what I have been lokking for:
I discovered the `suds.sax` module for which 
`the docs <https://fedorahosted.org/suds/wiki/Documentation#TECHNICALFYINOTES>`_ say
say that it
"was written because elementtree and other python XML packages 
either: 
have a DOM API which is very unfriendly 
or: (in the case of elementtree) do not 
deal with namespaces and especially prefixes sufficiently."

:mod:`lino.utils.xmlgen.cbss` is no longer used. 
Everything is now in :mod:`lino.modlib.cbss` and uses :term:`suds`.
New table RetrieveTIGroupsRequest.

Added test cases :mod:`lino.modlib.cbss.tests.cbss_tests`
Seems that I'm now ready to run these tests at the customer 
from behind a registered IP address.
This requires to set up a test instance on their server,
and that's for tomorrow.
