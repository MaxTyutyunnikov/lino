========

Today I solved two very subtle problems: 

- add (in an application) the fields `created` and `modified`
  to `contacts.Partner` using :class:`lino.mixins.CreatedModified`
- imported fields were not disabled on a Partner  


The trick was to override `contacts.Partner` instead of defining a `CpasPartner` mixin.

It is another usage example of our relatively new 
:attr:`lino.Lino.override_modlib_models` in the application's settings::

    override_modlib_models = [
        'contacts.Partner', 
        'contacts.Person', 'contacts.Company',
        'households.Household'
        ]

which required :class:`lino.modlib.contacts.models.Partner` to become overridable::

    class Meta:
        abstract = settings.LINO.is_abstract_model('contacts.Partner')


The current solution unfortunately works only 
when :djangoticket:`10808` is solved
(at least it's main part, the `assigned_fields` 
thing in `django/db/models/base.py`).
Which means that Lino currently would require to 
patch Django.
