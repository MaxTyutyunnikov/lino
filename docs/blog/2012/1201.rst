Hunting bugs in Django
----------------------

I upgraded the demo sites at :doc:`/demos`:
one thing is that I switched to the newest Lino and Lino-Welfare versions.

But especially I also switched to the Django 
development version in order to "pitch in and help them fix 
bugs before the final 1.5 release (due in December)" 
(as `they formulated it 
<https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/nov/27/15-beta-1/>`_).


Lino is not visible
-------------------

I did a Google search about "lino" and "django" and "extjs" 
and discovered that the Internet is really  obsolete. 
Google links people to pages that I wrote back in the previous decade. 
Time to change that!

On saffre-rumma.net, all requests to http://lino.saffre-rumma.net 
are now automatically and being redirected to 
http://lino-framework.org using a permanent redirect.

The Lino Wiki on GoogleCode is too bad: it looks like new and no 
way to make it say that it's obsolete. Started to delete pages. 
Blog entries from January to May 2010 were still only there. 
Now I added them to :srcref:`/docs/blog/2010`, but without yet 
converting them from Google's wiki markup to reStructuredText.
