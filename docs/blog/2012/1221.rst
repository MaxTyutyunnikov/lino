Calling http://demo2.lino-framework.org/admin/api/countries/Country/BE?fmt=plain
caused a TypeError "get_window_layout() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)",
:mod:`lino.ui.extjs3.views`, line 832. This was a simple typo bug.


Calling http://demo2.lino-framework.org/admin/api/cal/MyPresences?fmt=pdf
caused a PodError "I cannot write result file
`.../homeworkschool/media/cache/appypdf/cal.MyPresences.pdf`
[Errno 2] No such file or directory...".
The corresponding code forgot to call :func:`lino.core.modeltools.makedirs_if_missing`. 
By the way I solved a theoretic problem: if two simultaneous requests 
called a [pdf] version of the same actor, they would generate the same file. 
Now the filename includes the remote IP address.
