-----------------

Continued with :doc:`/tickets/63`.
Removed field `Entry.name`.

The new field `periods` means: for how many months 
(or any other period of time this budget is designed for) 
the entered amount counts.
Default value is 1. For yearly amounts set it to 12 
(when the budget is conceived with a monthly periodicity).
Currently there is no need to have the periodicity o a 
budget stored somewhere. Currently it is always "monthly".
I just didn't want to choose "months" as internal field 
name.


TODO:
- DecimalFieldelement.get_column_options had a bug (and has still).
