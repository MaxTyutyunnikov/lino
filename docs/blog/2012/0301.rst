xsd2xg
------

Yesterday I started some with first concrete attempts for the tx25 project.
While watching the 
:srcref:`XSD files </lino/sandbox/tx25/XSD>` I thought 
"No, I won't convert them manually to an xmlgen module, I'd rather write 
a tool like generateDS, but on that produces Python code which uses 
:mod:`lino.utils.xmlgen`".
I called it `xsd2xg`.
See :srcref:`/lino/sandbox/tx25` 
for the source.
I then started to understand that Dave Kuhlmann's work is not really trivial. 

Yes, I admit I'm crazy: I'm even going to continue. 
Just because I percieve the code generated by generateDS as difficult 
to understand and maintain.

Ian Bicking writes about xml.dom.minidom: 
"a document model built into the standard library, which html5lib can parse to. 
(I do not recommend using minidom for anything — some reasons will become 
apparent in this post, but there are many other reasons not covered why 
you shouldn’t use it.)"
(http://blog.ianbicking.org/2008/03/30/python-html-parser-performance/)

In that same post he also writes "I expected lxml to perform well, 
as it is based on the C library libxml2. But it performed better 
than I realized, far better than any other library. As a result, 
if it wasn’t for some persistent installation problems 
(especially on Macs) I would recommend lxml for just about any HTML task."

So I'm going to use `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`
