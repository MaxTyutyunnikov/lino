Yesterday and today I implemented
another important internal todo: I replaced the "confirmation" 
machinery be a new one which doesn't require a `step` variable and 
doesn't repeat code.
We can be glad that Lino isn't yet a popular framework,
because this was an important API change which 
caused some work to convert all existing `run` actions.
Before::

    def run(self,row,ar,**kw):
        ... code ...
        ar.confirm("Are you sure?")
        ... run after ok...

After::

    def run(self,row,ar,**kw):
        ... code ...
        def ok():
            ... run after ok...
        return ar.confirm(ok,"Are you sure?")

The overall system is still merely documented because not yet very stable.
The main things to document are:

- :meth:`prompt <lino.ui.base.UI.prompt>`
- :meth:`confirm <lino.ui.base.UI.confirm>`
- :meth:`success <lino.ui.base.UI.success>`
- :meth:`error <lino.ui.base.UI.error>`
