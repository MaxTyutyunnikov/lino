Monitoring a Lino site
----------------------

Lino should be able to send every day a 
monitor status to the admins of a site.
The first useful thing in such a status seems 
to be certain warnings:

- if the size on disk or number of records of a model has grown abnormally
- available disk space and size of log files

:mod:`lino.management.commands.diag` is not the right candidate 
to do this job (main purpose is a logical comparison of two dumps),
so we write a new command for this:
:mod:`lino.management.commands.monitor`.

How to find out the disk size 
used by the database table of each model?

- Currently only for the mysql backend. 

- PostGreSQL should be easy, too. 

- sqlite would be more tricky (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5900050/sqlite-table-disk-usage) 
  and probably never necessaary.
  
Okay, here is some first visible result::  
  
  luc@vps:~/mypy/demo_sites/welfare$ python manage.py  monitor

But there's still a lot to do. Not urgent.
