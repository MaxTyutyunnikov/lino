Monitoring a Lino site
----------------------

Lino should be able to send every day a 
monitor status to the admins of a site.

The first useful thing in shuch a status seems to be certain warnings:

- if the size on disk or number of records of a model has grown abnormally

:mod:`lino.management.commands.diag` is not the right candidate 
to do this job (main purpose is a logical comparison of two dumps),
so we write a new command for this:
:mod:`lino.management.commands.monitor`.

How to find outthe disk size 
used by the database table of each model?
Currently only for the mysql backend. 
PostGreSQL should be easy, too. 
sqlite would be more tricky and probably never necessaary.
