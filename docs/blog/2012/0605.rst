========

Wrote a new management command
:mod:`garble <lino.apps.pcsw.management.commands.garble>`
for :mod:`lino.apps.pcsw`.
This is used to turn a real database into a realistic demo database.

It changes the `last_name` and `first_name` of each person 
to a fictive name.
These fictive names are generated by the new module
:mod:`demonames <lino.utils.demonames>`
which has been split out of
:mod:`demo_fr <lino.contacts.fixtures.demo_fr>`
(see :doc:`/0228`).
Extended :class:`Cycler <lino.utils.Cycler>` to support "sub-cyclers".

Persons that are used for User accounts get not modified. 

:mod:`garble <lino.apps.pcsw.management.commands.garble>`
generates one foreigner per Belgian 
(where foreigners are either Russians or Moslems).
This is of course far from being representative, 
but it looks usable.
All generated Belgians have French first names
because I didn't yet find any easyly usable list of dutch first names.
