This is my diary about what I'm doing on Lino. 
As long as I am the only Lino developer, I'll write it mostly in German. 

The best system for blogging about a Python software project, 
AFAIK, is Sphinx.
Before this I tried also 
`Blogspot (Nov 2009-Feb 2010) <http://lsaffre.blogspot.com>`__ and
`googlecode's Wiki (Jan-June 2010) <http://code.google.com/p/lino/wiki/WikiBlog>`_

Note: older blog entries are currently not rendered here, 
but you can view their raw text in the source code repository under
:srcref:`/docs/blog`
