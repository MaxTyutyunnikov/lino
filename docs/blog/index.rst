  This is :ref:`Luc's <luc>` developer blog.
  It is the most detailed available documentation of what I am doing
  in all my software projects.
  Unlike normal blogs it has *at most one entry per day*.
  
  The best system for blogging about a Python software project, 
  AFAIK, is Sphinx.
  Before this I tried also 
  `Blogspot (Nov 2009-Feb 2010) <http://lsaffre.blogspot.com>`__ and
  `googlecode's Wiki (Jan-June 2010) <http://code.google.com/p/lino/wiki/WikiBlog>`_
  
  Older blog entries are currently not rendered here, 
  but you can view their raw text in the source code repository under
  :srcref:`/docs/blog`
