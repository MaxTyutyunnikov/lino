========

- Listing : 

  - New field `body_html` now stores the result of `body()`.
    Changed :file:`config/lino/DataControlListing/Default.odt`
    

  - removed fields 'header' and 'footer' because 
    ``do text from html(self.header())`` doesn't seem 
    to work when used in a page header or footer.
