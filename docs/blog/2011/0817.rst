Today I continued with the CalDAV functionality. Remember the bibliography:

- iCalendar : `RFC 5545 (Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object 
  Specification (iCalendar)) <ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc5545.txt>`_
  `iCalendar package for Python <http://codespeak.net/icalendar/>`_ 

- CalDAV : `RFC 4791 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4791.txt>`_,
  `python-caldav <http://packages.python.org/caldav/>`_
  (`Introduction <http://savetheions.com/2010/06/04/introducing-python-caldav>`_)
  
- vobject : http://vobject.skyhouseconsulting.com/usage.html  

Our plan is: 

- Lino imports general calendar events for each user from a CalDAV Server.
- Lino generates calendar events for coached persons. 
  These are first created in Lino and their creation synchronized 
  to a CalDAV server.

As a first step I got the introduction script from `python-caldav <http://packages.python.org/caldav/>`_ running:

   :language: python
