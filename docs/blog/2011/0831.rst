========

a) Test suite was failing
-------------------------

Fixed.

b) Switching off a `mti.EnableChild` deletes related objects
------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, if you switch off the is_courseprovider field of a Company, 
and if that Company (as a CourseProvider) has Courses defined, 
these Courses will be deleted without warning. Not so good.

c) Miscellaneous
----------------


Update Django from 1.4 pre-alpha SVN-16376 to
