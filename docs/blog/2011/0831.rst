========

a) Test suite was failing
-------------------------

Fixed.

b) Switching off a `mti.EnableChild` deletes related objects
------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, if you switch off the is_courseprovider field of a Company, 
and if that Company (as a CourseProvider) has Courses defined, 
these Courses will be deleted without warning. Not so good.

c) Miscellaneous
----------------

One user reporst the following error message during :term:`initdb`::

  django.db.utils.IntegrityError: (1217, 'Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails') 


After updating my Django copy from 1.4 pre-alpha SVN-16376 to 16714, 
I realized that the new Django version 
doesn't any longer allow a trick which I used in 
:class:`lino.utils.dpy.Deserializer`. 
So I had to redesign this.
