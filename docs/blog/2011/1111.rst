Started support user-specific language support. 
The basic trick is to add 
`django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware` to the 
:setting:`MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`.
This makes Django ask the user's browser's language 
preferences when setting 
`request.LANGUAGE_CODE`.

Until now I thought that was enough...
but in fact there are a few places 
where I need to adapt Lino.

First and most evident was that the server must generate not only 
one file :xfile:`lino.js` at startup, but one for each language.
That wasn't too difficult.

Next problem is that `choicelists.ChoiceList` triggers 
translation when filling her `choices` list. 
That's subtile! Not yet solved.
