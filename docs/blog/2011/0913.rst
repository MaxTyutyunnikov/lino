========

Continued with :term:`pp2lino`. 

The :class:`lino.mixins.ProjectRelated` mixin was added to 
:class:`lino.modlib.cal.models.Event`
and
:class:`lino.modlib.cal.models.Task` 
only in :mod:`lino.apps.dsbe.models`. 
Now that's done already in the modlib, 
and they are no longer are abstract there.
Seems more practical.
