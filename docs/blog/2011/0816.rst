Yes, Lino sucks: he deprives me from sleep. 
But OTOH it's really amazing: it took me less than an 
hour to solve the three remaining points:

- `sent_time` field and refusing to send a second time. 
- preview of the mail that is about to be sent. 
- There can be more than one mail per Attendance: e.g. if `confirmed` 
  is empty, we send an invitaton. Or more variants depending on 
  status etc.
