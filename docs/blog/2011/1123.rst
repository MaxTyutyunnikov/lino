The owner of an Event or a Task
-------------------------------

Automatic Calendar Events and Tasks have some fields read-only 
because they are "owned" or "governed" or "controlled" 
by the object which caused their automatic creation.
If that object is being modified, it may decide to delete or 
modify all its automatic task.
Lino identifies them as their `owner` field is non-empty.
And that's a `GenericForeignKey`. 
See :class:`lino.mixins.Owned`.
And this field wasn't well rendered yet.
Now it is rendered as a read-only clickable text that 
will bring the user to the owner.
