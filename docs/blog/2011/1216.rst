Continued on :doc:`/tickets/52`. 
The CalendarStore not only needed a `idProperty` but also an `idIndex` config option.
I didn't understand 100% why, but now it works perfectly.

The `color` of a :class:`lino.modlib.cal.models.Calendar` no longer 
is a virtual field but a simple `models.IntegerField`. 

A few important things are missing before I can say that CalendarPanel 
is integrated: creating events and updating events.

But also an almost philosphical question: where should the label "Calendar" 
(and it's translations) be stored?
