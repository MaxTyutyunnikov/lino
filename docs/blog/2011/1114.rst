Choice Lists
------------

Choice Lists had a design flaw: they used `babel.BabelText` 
instances to store the items, but it is better to use simple 
translatable strings (`gettext_lazy`). 
All currently existing choicelists have been converted:

- :class:`lino.apps.dsbe.models.CefLevel`
- :class:`lino.modlib.mails.utils.DurationUnit`
- :class:`lino.modlib.cal.utils.DurationUnit`
- :class:`lino.utils.choicelists.HowWell`
- :class:`lino.utils.choicelists.HowMuch`

The new choicelist
:class:`lino.utils.choicelists.Gender`
is now being used 
to create the `gender` fields in 
:class:`lino.apps.dsbe.models.Person`
and :class:`lino.apps.dsbe.models.PersonSearch`.
Unit test cases and fixtures have been adapted.
One advantage is that Lino no longer accepts 
a simple 'M' as valid value on a gender field. 
User code must import the `Gender` choicelist 
and use the "constants" defined there.

The following new models replace the formerly 
used choice list of same name. 
It became clear from recent user 
interviews that these lists cannot be hard-coded.

- :class:`lino.modlib.cal.models.TaskStatus`
- :class:`lino.modlib.cal.models.EventStatus`
- :class:`lino.modlib.cal.models.AccessClass`
- :class:`lino.modlib.cal.models.Priority`

The previously hard-coded values are now in a 
new fixture :mod:`lino.modlib.cal.fixtures.std`

The plural of "Status"
----------------------

What is the plural of "Status"? 
Answer: "Statuses". At least in English.
But in German the official plural form is "Status", 
written like the singular form and pronounced with a long "u".
That's why I'm going to translate "Status" by "Zustand" 
which has a better plural form.


BCSS connection
---------------

There was a bug in 
:meth:`lino.modlib.bcss.models.IdentifyPersonRequest.build_service`: 
if national_id known, it filled both LastName and FirstName with the person's `last_name`.

Another problem: 
if national_id and birth_date empty, 
the reply said
"An error occurred during the parsing of the request body. Please check your message format." 
and 
"Uncompleted content model. expecting: <BirthDate>,<MiddleName>".
Seems that in the MiddleName element in PhoneticSearch must be present even if it is empty.
These are probably the kind of things which :term:`generateDS` would detect already when 
generating the XML.
