Editable `id` field of MTI childen
----------------------------------

The `id` field of a Company or Person was never disabled.
:class:`lino.ui.extjs3.ext_store.DisabledFieldsStoreField` 
now checks whether `models._meta.pk` is a `OneToOneField`.
New test case :func:`lino.apps.dsbe.tests.dsbe_tests.test06` 
was used to understand this problem.

Execution order in :class:`lino.utils.test.TestCase`
----------------------------------------------------

:meth:`lino.utils.test.TestCase.test_them_all` now sorts 
the test functions found in the module's globale namespace before 
executing them.
Since all 'testXX' functions are run in a same database, their execution 
order may be important: keep in mind that they are executed in 
*alphabetical* order, and that database changes remain for the whole 
sequence.


Missing column `date_submitted` in `CourseRequestsByPerson`
-----------------------------------------------------------

There was no column `date_submitted` in the `CourseRequestsByPerson` 
grid.
This was because 
:attr:`lino.apps.dsbe.models.CourseRequest.date_submitted` was 
declared with `auto_now_add=True` 
which makes it readonly, 
and because a ``*`` in 
:attr:`lino.reports.Report.column_names` does not expand to readonly fields.
