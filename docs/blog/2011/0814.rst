Face-lifting for iGen
---------------------

Started to work on the prototype for a new customer who is going to use iGen.

New module :mod:`lino.modlib.mails`
-----------------------------------

The new module :mod:`lino.modlib.mails` turns Lino into a potential 
mail client. We don't expect to become as user-friendly 
as the existing mail clients, but we'll use this to

- import mails (outgoing and incoming) and integrate them into 
  our data. For example "In the Detail view of a contact 
  I want to see all mails sent to and received from this contact,
  and not only on own account but on all my colleagues."
  
- automatically generate outgoing mails and keep track of them.
  For example a travel booking confirmation, 
  a convocation (invitation to a rendez-vous),
  an order confirmation, an invoice,...
