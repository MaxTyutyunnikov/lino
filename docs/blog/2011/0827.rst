========

The flag used to define and see whether we are loading 
a serialized dump (not a programmed one) 
(see :doc:`0727`)
is now :attr:`lino.Lino.loading_from_dump`.
It is now set from within the dump itself, 
generated by 
:meth:`lino.utils.dpy.Serializer.serialize`::

  settings.LINO.loading_from_dump = True

This has the advantage that application specific 
migration modules don't need to worry about setting it.
We are going to use this flag when loading 
back events of a remote calendar.
