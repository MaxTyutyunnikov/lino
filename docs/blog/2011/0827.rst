New flag :attr:`lino.Lino.loading_from_dump`
--------------------------------------------

The flag used to define and see whether we are loading 
a serialized dump (generated by 
:meth:`lino.utils.dpy.Serializer.serialize`, 
not a programmed fixture) 
(see :doc:`0727`)
is now :attr:`lino.Lino.loading_from_dump`.
It is now set from within the dump itself::

  settings.LINO.loading_from_dump = True

This has the advantage that application specific 
migration modules don't need to worry about setting it.
We are going to use this flag when loading 
back events of a remote calendar.

Verbose name of ForeignKey fields
---------------------------------

If the `verbose_name`of a ForeignKey 
was not set by user code, 
Django sets it to ``field.name.replace('_', ' ')``
as for every field.
We replace this default value by ``field.rel.to._meta.verbose_name``.

Advantage is that `lino.mixins.ProjectRelated.project` 
gets a correct label. The word "Project" as label would be 
incorrect or at least irritating for Lino/DSBE users.

Possible unwanted side effects if a model has more than one FK 
to the same model. But in that case, user code should simple 
specify an explicit `verbose_name` for those FK fields.


Bug on sites with nonempty :attr:`lino.Lino.root_url`
-----------------------------------------------------

Fixed: `/grid_config` and `/detail_config` didn't 
work on nonempty :attr:`lino.Lino.root_url`.
