Continued with Calendar Panel
-----------------------------

I managed to have the Calendar panel filled with Lino's Events.
(I added a new report PanelEvents, virtual fields Event.dt_start and Event.dt_end)

But another problem appeared: 
I want (or rather need) to use the FormPanel defined by Lino
when editing the details of an event.
That seems not so easy because Lino.FormPanel constructor takes a 
special parameter `ww`.
All Lino panels have this pointer to their containing window wrapper.

But `Ext.ensible.cal.CalendarPanel` has no API to specify a 
custom function that creates the editor form, 
I must replace the 'extensible.eventeditform' 
with my own class 
(whose constructor must work with the standard ExtJS signature).

:file:`extensible-all.js` does::

  Ext.reg('extensible.eventeditform', Ext.ensible.cal.EventEditForm);

And I plan to do::

  Ext.reg('extensible.eventeditform', Lino.EventEditForm);

But first I want to make Lino.FormPanel usable without a `containing_window` 
in the constructor.

This causes an avalanche of changes:

Moved the `save()` functions from DetailWrapper and InsertWrapper 
to a single function in `FormPanel`.
It tests rec.phantom to decide whether it's a POST or a PUT.

Seems to work. Checkin.

Changed the generated javascript code.

Changed  `analyze_models()` in `kernel.py`, preparing to the new concept 
for defining Details.

The mechanism for rendering the picture of a person was very sophisticated 
and required even an additional AJAX call to get the URL of the picture. 
And the result was suboptimal since the picture were stretched to 
fill the rectangle.
Replaced by a simple :class:`lino.fields.HtmlBox` field::

    def image2(self,request):
        return '<img src="%s" width="120px"/>' % self.get_image_url()
    image2.return_type = fields.HtmlBox()

Layouts are now still Record-based, but everything is ready to make 
them model-based.

Checkin 20111126 07:03 because it seems to work so far
(except that `before_row_edit` isn't called on a GridPanel).
