Opened :doc:`/tickets/44`. 
Tried a solution lino.utils.textfields`, but dropped it again and 
even removed the "expand_memos" attribute from Report
and the "memos" button from Lino.GridPanel
because I understood that the server-side approach
cannot work. Cropping must be done at the client.

And the solution is really simple:
just added `height:18px` and `overflow:hidden` 
(and removed `white-space: normal`)
to the cell's style in :xfile:`lino.css`::

  .x-grid3-cell-inner, .x-grid3-hd-inner {
    /* white-space: normal; changed from nowrap */
    height:18px; overflow:hidden;
  }
