I wrote a new module :mod:`lino.utils.xmlgen` which I prefer over 
libraries like generateDS or `appy.Object`

A little bug
------------

Read-only checkboxes are only grey but not read-only. 
Seems that this is due to a bug in ExtJS.
For example on the Detail of a JobProvider, if you activate the 
checkbox is_courseprovider and click on Save, you get::

  ERROR A JobProvider cannot be parent for a CourseProvider
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "t:\hgwork\lino\lino\ui\extjs3\ext_store.py", line 651, in form2obj
      f.form2obj(request,instance,form_values,is_new)
    File "t:\hgwork\lino\lino\ui\extjs3\ext_store.py", line 124, in form2obj
      self.set_value_in_object(request,instance,v)
    File "t:\hgwork\lino\lino\utils\mti.py", line 187, in set_value_in_object
      insert_child(obj,self.child_model)
    File "t:\hgwork\lino\lino\utils\mti.py", line 123, in insert_child
      obj.__class__.__name__,child_model.__name__))
  Exception: A JobProvider cannot be parent for a CourseProvider

Changed this (in :func:`lino.utils.mti.insert_child`) to raise a 
ValidationError instead of an Exception.

Also removed the assertion ``assert child_model != obj.__class__``
(which occurred today) because in that case we would simply not find 
any `parent_link_field`, which would lead to the validation error 
"A CourseProvider cannot be parent for a CourseProvider"
