More details to do for the support of 
user-specific language selection.

:class:`lino.apps.dsbe.models.CefLevel` overrides `display_text`, 
and this method wasn't yet adapted to yesterday's changes.

There are still some places where Lino translates too early: 

- the headers of tabs
- labels of buttons and menus

There is one conceptual detail which needed a design decision: 
how to mark hotkey letters in menu items.
Until now we had the following temporary solution::

  def prepare_label(mi):
      label = unicode(mi.label) # trigger translation
      n = label.find(mi.HOTKEY_MARKER)
      if n != -1:
          label = label.replace(mi.HOTKEY_MARKER,'')
      return label

This doesn't work any longer with lazy translation.
