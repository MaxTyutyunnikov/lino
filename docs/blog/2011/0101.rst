========

- `Russell Keith-Magee <http://cecinestpasun.com/about/>`_ 
  has worked on :djangoticket:`14390` (my :doc:`/tickets/19/`).
  He closed it because it were due to a Python bug (which I'll try to confirm).
  I won't pay too much enery to this ticket since it is anyway just a partly 
  solution to the localized sorting problem.
