========

:attr:`lino.modlib.jobs.models.Candidature.job` was nullable, 
which caused an 
`AttributeError 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'` in 
:meth:`lino.modlib.jobs.models.Candidature.__unicode__`
when a user tried to save a Candidatur without a Job specified.
  
:term:`initdb` now calls `syncdb` with `verbosity=0` to avoid the 
irritating message "No fixtures found" (which comes because there 
are no `initial_data` fixtures).

There was no column `date_submitted` in the `CandidatursByPerson` 
grid.
This was because 
:attr:`lino.apps.jobs.models.CandidatursByPerson.date_submitted` was 
declared with `auto_now_add=True` 
which makes it readonly, 
and because a ``*`` in 
:attr:`lino.reports.Report.column_names` does not expand to readonly fields.
