- Bugfix: Comboboxes always showed "Page 1 of 1", even if there were more 
  than one pageful of choices.
  
The "Clear cache" button on a :class:`lino.mixins.printable.CachedPrintable` 
was a gotcha which potentially had a user delete a WebDAV-edited document.
Lino needs to protect the user from accidentally deleting their changes. 
The idea is that Lino asks an additional confirmation 
"Are you sure you want to discard all changes in the generated file?"
when the user clicks on "Clear cache" and the document has been edited 
after Lino generated it.

A first change was relatively easy:

- In :class:`lino.mixins.printable.CachedPrintable`:
  BooleanField `must_build` has been replaced by a DateTimeField `build_time`.
  
A second required change was in fact a long-waiting new feature 
"action confirmations".
For application code it is easy: 
the ``rr.confirm()`` call in the example below will raise an exception 
if the user answers "No" to the question.
Here is how this looks in 
:class:`lino.mixins.printable.ClearCacheAction`::

    def run(self,rr,elem):
        if elem.get_cache_mtime() != elem.build_time:
            rr.confirm(1,
                _("This will discard all changes in the generated file."),
                _("Are you sure?"))
          
        elem.build_time = None
        elem.save()
        return rr.ui.success_response("%s printable cache has been cleared." % elem,refresh=True)
        
The challenge was how to implement this without using cookies and sessions!

The following problem appeared today:: 

  Error while evaluating the expression "document(at=self.person.get_image_path(),anchor="as-char")" defined in the "from" part of a statement.

It was solved by getting the version 0.8.0 from https://launchpad.net/appy
