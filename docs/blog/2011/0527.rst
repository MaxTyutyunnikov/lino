- Grâce à http://www.wout-bosteels.be/countries.xml
  countries/fixtures/all_countries.dpy importe maintenant la 
  liste des pays en français et néerlandais.
  
- I noticed that some models didn't have their babel fields expanded 
  in a Layout:

    countries.Language
    countries.Country
    dsbe.ContractType
    dsbe.ExamPolicy
    dsbe.AidType
    
  This bug has been active for some time and nobody noticed it.
  Fortunately it was only a UI problem. 
  The dump files did write all data.

  The still used `babel.add_babel_field` instead of `babel.BabelCharField`.
