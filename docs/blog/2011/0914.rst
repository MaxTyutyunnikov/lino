========

Mails
-----

Database change in :mod:`lino.modlib.mails`: there's only one table 
`Mail`, not two separate tables `OutMail` and `InMail`.

Job Requests
------------

Tilt! :mod:`lino.modlib.jobs` does not need a PersonsByOffer, 
but a RequestsByOffer.
Entering a Job Offer now gives reasonable results in the "Candidate" 
slave grid.
Added some sectors and functions in dsbe/demo fixture.
