========

I just discovered that I have all my `CharField` with null=True, 
and that this is just the opposite of what Django wants.
Added assertion in Lino kernel to avoid this in the future.

:mod:`initdb <lino.management.commands.initdb>` now no longer 
displays the disturbing "No fixtures found". It came from 
the implicit flush command who looked for `initial_data` fixtures 
and never found any (because I prefer `std`).
