========

I just discovered that I have all my `CharField` with null=True, 
and that this is just the opposite of what Django wants.
Added assertion in Lino kernel to avoid this in the future.
https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9590

:mod:`initdb <lino.management.commands.initdb>` now no longer 
displays the disturbing "No fixtures found". It came from 
the implicit flush command who looked for `initial_data` fixtures 
and never found any (because I prefer `std`).


No, I reverted my yesterday's changes to initdb. Django's flush 
command may cause the following error when applied before a 
database migration::

  Error: Database mysite couldn't be flushed. Possible reasons:
    * The database isn't running or isn't configured correctly.
    * At least one of the expected database tables doesn't exist.
    * The SQL was invalid.
  Hint: Look at the output of 'django-admin.py sqlflush'. That's the SQL this command wasn't able to run.
  The full error: (1146, "Table 'mysite.contacts_roletype' doesn't exist")

I guess that Django's flush doesn't an an IF EXIST clause to the DROP TABLE statement.
