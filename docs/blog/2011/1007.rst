========

:mod:`lino.apps.dsbe.fixtures.demo` now 
uses the romanized form "Tatjana Kasennova"
instead of "Татьяна Казеннова". 

The idea behind this was to show that cyrillic characters are supported.
But this was more: it was a mix of cyrillic and other alphabets in a same 
table column.
While sqlite accepts this and doesn't really bother about how to 
sort them correctly,
MySQL with charset ``utf8`` and the default 
collation ``utf8_general_ci`` does *not accept*
cyrillic characters, saying::

  Warning: Incorrect string value: '\xD0\x9A\xD0\xB0\xD0\xB7...' for column 'name' at row 1
  
So this example was not very useful and needs special configuration 
tricks on MySQL. 

:func:`lino.tools.obj2str` now handles the fact that values of an `AutoField` 
are sometimes simple ``int`` and somtimes ``long`` integers.
