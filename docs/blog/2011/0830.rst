========

(a) Make individual rows read-only 
----------------------------------

The new special model method :modmeth:`disable_editing`
is used on :class:`lino.modlib.cal.models.Event` 
to make recurrent events read-only. 

This is a temporary workaround because editing recurrent 
events is rather tricky, and for :mod:`lino.apps.dsbe` 
it is enough when Lino imports them from a remote calendar.
