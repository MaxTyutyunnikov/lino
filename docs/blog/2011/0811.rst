========

Writing the first tutorial gave me ideas on how to 
make Lino more easy to understand.

New class attributes 
:attr:`lino.Lino.extjs_root`
and
:attr:`lino.Lino.tinymce_root`.

When a :class:`lino.Lino` is instantiated, it now tries to 
import a module `sitecustomize_lino`, and if this exists, 
a function `on_init`, and if this exists, it will be 
executed on the instance. 
This is to customize local settings that should be applied 
for all Lino sites on a given machine.

:xfile:`.dtl` files now have a different naming and structuring. 
The :xfile:`doctemplates` directory has gone. 
Document templates `.odt` are now simply together with :xfile:`.dtl` 
files in these per-table directories.
