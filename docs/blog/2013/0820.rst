Continued on the :doc:`/todo`. An appearently innocent user request 
was:

-  Button "eID-Inhalt" wird im Empfang nicht benutzt. Raus.

How to "remove" an inherited action or collected from a table?
Most intuitive method is to explicitly set it to None.

But... 
this wasn't yet possible.
And I took three hours to solve this.
Much time for such a small optimization, 
but it is relatively subtle, and I decided that now it is time 
to start a new tutorial about :doc:`/tutorials/actions/index`
which tests the new feature and gives (or will give one day) a
good entry point for developers.
