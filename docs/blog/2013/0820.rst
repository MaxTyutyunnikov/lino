How to "remove" an inherited action or collected from a table?
Most intuitive method to explicitly set it to None.
This wasn't yet possible and took me three hours to solve.
Much time for such a small optimization, 
but it is relatively subtle, and I decided that now it is time 
to start a new tutorial about :doc:`/tutorials/actions/index`
which tests the new feature and gives (or will give one day) a
good entry point for developers.
