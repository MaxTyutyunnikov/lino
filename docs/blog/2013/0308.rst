========


- More changes in :class:`djangosite.Site`:
  - renamed `short_name` to `verbose_name`
  - removed `description`
- Moved the local site_setup system from Lino to Djangosite.
  System admins must rename all "lino_local" modules to "djangosite_local"
  and the `on_init` therein to `setup_site`.
