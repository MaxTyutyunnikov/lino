Released Lino-Welfare 1.1.8
===========================

I released :ref:`Lino-Welfare 1.1.8 <welfare.changes>`.

Determine project interdependencies:
The last release (1.1.7) was 2013-06-04.
By consulting the diffs of the changelogs, I saw that 
atelier, djangosite and north had no 
runtime-relevant changes since that date.
Lino the framework does have.
