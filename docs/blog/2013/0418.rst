AttributeError: 'Site' object has no attribute 'getlanguage_info'
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A little bug caused Tx25 documents to not be printable.
Fixing the bug took 5 minutes, plus another 25 minutes to 
write a testcase, this one as a "tested doc": 
:ref:`welfare.tested.cbss`.

This also revealed another error 
"AttributeError: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'LINO'"
in the template for printing a Tx25 (which just caused the version to 
not appear on the printed document)

Another bug
"Exception: Request <TableRequest pcsw.UsersWithClients.grid({})> was already executed"
caused the print table as pdf function to not work.
Tested in :ref:`welfare.tested.pcsw`
