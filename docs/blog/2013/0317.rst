- NotImplementedError: <ul> inside <text:p>

  :mod:`lino.utils.html2odf` isn't yet able to convert  
  <ul>, <ol> and <li> elements to a OpenDocument chunk.
  
- :mod:`djangosite.utils.fablib` now touches the 
  blog's `index.rst` file when it starts a new entry.

- py2rst directives now also get "self" and "env" 
  variables in their context.
  
- Started to write release notes for
  `Lino-Welfare 1.1.0 <http://welfare.lino-framework.org/releases/1.1.0.html>`__.
  I did some experiments with new methods for writing
  `User documentation <http://welfare.lino-framework.org/user/index.html>`_.
  A little visible result of the rather internal work of the last weeks. Wow.
