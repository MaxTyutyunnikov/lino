"api/ui/Home/-99998 was not found on this server"
-------------------------------------------------

Trying to reproduce a problem report by Flavio:

    Following the recommendations according to Lino web site, 
    I set up a deployment environment with Apache and HTTP authentication, 
    first for demo application Lino Cos√≠. 
    The application loads the Javascript files, accesses the database 
    and returns back the full name of the logged-in user, but got the 
    following error after the authentication:

    | "Not Found
    | The requested URL / api/ui/Home/-99998 was not found on this server."

    Which happens in any attempt to access the information in the database such as in /api/contacts/Persons.

At first sight I could not reproduce this problem with the latest 
development version on a development server.
Which version is he using?
Going to set up a test environment for Apache HTTP authentication 
since the problem might occur only then.

Fixed a bug which is probably unrelated:
:meth:`ExtRenderer <lino.extjs.ExtRenderer.html_page_lines>`
generated a line which requested a file 
"/media/extensible/extensible-all-debug.js"
which always lead to a 404 error, but that did no harm since 
it was useless.

Checkin and ask Flavio to try with this version.
