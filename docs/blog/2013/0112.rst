========

- Updated :mod:`lino.test_apps.20121124` because 
  :djangoticket:`19360`(annotate the sum of related TimeField)
  has been closed.
  
  

The :mod:`lino.modlib.countries.fixtures.be` fixture now supposes that :mod:`few_cities` 
has also been loaded and thus does not load the few Belgian cities defined there.
This is because now that City is BabelNamed it is more complex to detect 
whether a City aready has been created or not.
