=================================

One of the two technical challenges seems solved:

- Executing the "Read eID card" action on a client 
  using the JS link of the new "Actions" 
  field now works.
  
Since all this is very complex and not automatically tested, 
it might cause bugs at the JavaScript level.
So I marked this change with "AFTER_20130725" in `linoweb.js` 
and `extjs/__init__.py`

The second challenge is even more sophisticated and not yet solved:

- A reception clerk sees the :ref:`welfare.reception.ExpectedGuests` table
  rendered as HTML in their `admin_main.html`, very nice, 
  but the "Checkout" actions don't work from there.

Buttons for actions with parameters aren't yet possible 
when rendering to plain HTML.
But Lino now at least says 
"Sorry, this action don't work when called directly from the Home page".
