Cool: Lino now has the conecpt of a "Report".
a Report is a longer document with a "story": a sequence of 
headings, tables and free text.
One important fact is that Lino can render a Report 
as an ExtJS window or as a pdf document.
(the latter isn't yet fully functional, and my guinea pig report 
needs more enduser feedback, so i don't dare to publish 
screenshots)
