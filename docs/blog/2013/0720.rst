:mod:`lino_welfare.fixtures.demo` had a problem when it was together 
with :mod:`lino.modlib.countries.fixtures.be`. It said
"MultipleObjectsReturned: 
get() returned more than one City -- 
it returned 2! Lookup parameters were {'zip_code__exact': u'4780'}"
because both Recht and Sankt Vith have the same zip code 4780.
