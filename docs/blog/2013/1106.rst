======================================

Today at midnight I plan to participate for the first time to a meeting
of the sacredpy project.
Tried to reproduce Catherine's problem with her askbot fork::

  git clone https://github.com/reibwo/askbot-devel.git
  
But there is so much new stuff for me, I got locked without any result.

Preferred to work on :ref:`polly`.

Discovered and fixed a bug in the framework: 
when a Table had both
`variable_row_height`
and 
`auto_fit_column_widths`
set to True, then `auto_fit_column_widths` was ignored when the 
table was rendered as a slave in a detail.

polls.Question.choiceset is now nullable, and in that case the Poll's 
`default_choiceset` is used. This is so that when you change the 
`default_choiceset` of a Poll you don't need to change all Questions 
of that Poll.
