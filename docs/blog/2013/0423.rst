'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'subst_user'
--------------------------------------------------

I finally looked up why I received often a series of error messages
"'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'subst_user'" from the demo 
sites. These server tracebacks were caused by html HEAD requests 
issued by my own monitor.
:mod:`lino.utils.auth` forgot to set `request.subst_user` to `None`
in such cases.
Wrote some docstrings in module :mod:`lino.utils.auth`.
New class :mod:`lino.utils.auth.AuthMiddleWareBase`.

User message when contract type empty
-------------------------------------

The `type` field of 
:ref:`welfare.isip.Contract`
and
:ref:`welfare.jobs.Contract`
is declared `blank=True` but `null=False`.
Which is what we want: 
if the user submits an empty value for this field, 
Lino should fill a default value before saving it.
But in some cases Lino cannot determine a default value.
In this cases, the user saw only a message "Server-side failure" 
instead of something meaningful which says that she just forgot 
to fill in the "Contract type" field.
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.isip.models.ContractBase`
now raises ValidationErrror "You must specify a contract type."
Optimizations in 
:mod:lino.ui.views`
and :mod:lino.ui.store`.


.pdf table doesn't always render
--------------------------------

:ref:`welfare.jobs.NewJobsOverview` implements the new user-requested 
layout and works very well... on `hoppel` and on `lf.org`, 
but *not* on `dsbe`.

Here is a table with some first observations:

======= === ============ =========================== ========
machine ok  LO/OOo       OS                          Python
======= === ============ =========================== ========
hoppel  ok  libreoffice  Ubuntu                      2.7
lf.org  ok  openoffice   Debian Lenny stable         2.6.6
dsbe    -   libreoffice  Debian Lenny stable         2.6.6
======= === ============ =========================== ========

To gather more information I added a temporary call to `logging.info` in 
:meth:`lino.utils.appy_pod.Renderer.insert_table`.
