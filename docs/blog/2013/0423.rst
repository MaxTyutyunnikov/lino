'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'subst_user'
--------------------------------------------------

I finally looked up why I received often a series of error messages
"'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'subst_user'" from the demo 
sites. These server tracebacks were caused by html HEAD requests 
issued by my own monitor.
:mod:`lino.utils.auth` forgot to set `request.subst_user` to `None`
in such cases.
Wrote some docstrings in module :mod:`lino.utils.auth`.
New class :mod:`lino.utils.auth.AuthMiddleWareBase`.

User message when contract type empty
-------------------------------------

The `type` field of 
:ref:`welfare.isip.Contract`
and
:ref:`welfare.jobs.Contract`
is declared `blank=True` but `null=False`.
Which is what we want: 
if the user submits an empty value for this field, 
Lino should fill a default value before saving it.
But in some cases Lino cannot determine a default value.
In this cases, the user saw only a message "Server-side failure" 
instead of something meaningful which says that she just forgot 
to fill in the "Contract type" field.
