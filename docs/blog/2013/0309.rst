I renamed "django-north" to "North" on PyPI.

Here is how I did it:

  t:\hgwork\north> pip uninstall django-north

In setup.py, change `name` from "django-north" to "North"

  t:\hgwork\north> python setup.py register
  t:\hgwork\north> pip install -e .
  
In a first attempt of `python setup.py register` I had the 
following error message::

  running check
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "setup.py", line 4, in <module>
      setup(**SETUP_INFO)
    ...
    File "c:\Python27\lib\site-packages\docutils\nodes.py", line 1021, in set_id
      for id in node['ids']:
  TypeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__getitem__'


This was because I used the text role "xfile" 
(unknown for PyPI which uses only docutils and not Sphinx) 
in my :xfile:`README.txt` file::

  Basic usage in your :xfile:`settings.py` file is...
  
  
I then also renamed "django-site" to "DjangoSite" on PyPI.
Which I then regretted and undid.
