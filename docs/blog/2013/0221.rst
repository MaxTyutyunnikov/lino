Unit testing produces problems
------------------------------

The release with yesterday's small bugfixes was almost ready:

- Release notes:
  :doc:`Lino 1.5.1 </releases/1.5.10>`
  :welfare:`Welfare 1.0.13 </releases/1.0.13>`
  
But there was time left before the evening, so I started to clean up 
the test suite. This included a series of little internal optimizations
in the startup process (details see yesterday (German only). 
Everything seemed fine and innocent until I deployed it 
on the `lino-framework.org` server:
some strange failures, probably due to threading issues.
Finally these small optimizations I made for the 
test suite had triggered an avalanche of changes,
each of them very welcome and probably making Lino better 
in the long run... but not really at the right moment. 
Of course these surprises disturb my release process only because 
I don't use branching as I should...
