====================================

Continued on :ref:`faggio`.
Generating more demo data.
:mod:`lino.modlib.ledger.fixtures.mini` now generates simple 
monthly sales invoices with 3 products Foo, Bar and Baz.

Added a "basic accounting truths" section to 
:ref:`faggio.tested.faggio`. 
These things are still evolving.
For example a **Sales** journal has its `dc` field set to **Debit**,
but what exactly does that mean?
It means that a voucher with a non-negative total amount will 
debitate the **partner account** (and thus creditate the sales account).

Since :class:`DebitOrCreditField <lino.modlib.accounts.models.DebitOrCreditField>` 
is basically just a BooleanField, it used to be rendered as a checkbox.
Now we have a new magic attribute "lino_atomizer_class".
We don't want to define this as a core atomizer because this 
implementation is just one possible choice.
