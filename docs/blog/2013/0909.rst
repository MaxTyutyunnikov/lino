====================================

Updated :doc:`/todo`.
I am going to have three days of forced holiday because I'm going to 
enjoy a `FESS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_endoscopic_sinus_surgery>`_ 
in Tallinn.

I fixed the following bug:

-   When user changes some value of a parameter panel, then closes the 
    window and reopens it, then Lino doesn't reset the parameterss to 
    their default value.
    
    This was in `Lino.MainPanel` in :xfile:`linoweb.js`:
    `_force_dirty` was never set to false.
