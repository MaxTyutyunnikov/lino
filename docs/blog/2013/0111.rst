Hosting multiple Lino sites
---------------------------

Before doing an upgrade in Eupen I'd like to do it on lino-framework.org, 
and before *that* I'd like to run more tests because recently there were some 
problems related to certain demo fixtures not working in certain 
language configurations.
And I had some ideas about how to automate these tests.
New documentation page :doc:`/admin/local_lino`.
These things are good to solve before a first partner 
gets started with Lino mass hosting.

- :meth:`lino.Lino.__init__` no longer hardcodedly tries to 
  import a `sitecustomize_lino` module::

        try:
            from sitecustomize_lino import on_init
        except ImportError:
            pass
        else:
            on_init(self)

- In :class:`lino.Lino`, renamed the site attribute `settings_dict` to 
  :attr:`<django_settings> lino.Lino.django_settings`.
  
- New management command `initdb_demo <lino.management.commands.initdb_demo>`
  and new Lino setting :attr:`demo_fixtures <lino.Lino.demo_fixtures>`.
  

Release
-------

Is it possible to use the distutils `setup.py upload` command several times for 
the same version?

Until now I always did the following when releasing ::

  python setup.py register sdist --formats=gztar,zip upload
  
But can I **upload** a version without previously **registering** it?
Yes::

  python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip upload
  adding 'lino-1.5.3\tests\misc\choices.py'
  adding 'lino-1.5.3\tests\misc\diag.py'
  removing 'lino-1.5.3' (and everything under it)
  running upload
