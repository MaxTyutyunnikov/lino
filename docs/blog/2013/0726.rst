===============================

The :ref:`lino.tutorial.polls` was broken for several reasons:

- the `admin_main.html` template was still in `templates_jinja`
- vote actions didn't work due to :blogref:`20130524`
  (as expected in :blogref:`20130525`)

Optimized the `admin_main.html` template. The following code::

    {% for obj in poll.choice_set.all() %}
      {{site.modules.polls.Choices.vote.as_button(obj,request,unicode(obj))}
  
has become::  
  
    {% for obj in poll.choice_set.all() %}
      {{ obj.vote.as_button(request,unicode(obj))}}
  

Ext.ensible 1.0.2
-----------------

Oho, where has version 1.0.2 gone? 
Until recently it was still available under 
http://ext.ensible.com/deploy/1.0.2/extensible-all-debug.js. 
Maybe Brian believes that nobody uses ExtJS 3 anymore?
