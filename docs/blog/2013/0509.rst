Polymorphism
------------

The Cosi demo site had generated an interesting traceback 
which lead to another step in the evolution of 
:mod:`lino.modlib.partners` (which is currently 
being used by :mod:`lino.projects.cosi`).
The challenge was to display a table with the ledger invoices of 
a Person or Organisation in a way that works with both 
possible choices for :attr:`lino.ui.Site.partners_app_label`.
The new method :meth:`lino.core.model.Model.get_typed_instance`
is necessary for this. 

New document :ref:`cosi.tested` with a first 
section "Person #115 is not a Partner"
which reproduced the traceback.

(Yes :ref:`polymorphism` without MTI isn't yet fully functional
needs better documentation)


Kernel driver not installed
---------------------------

Using Ubuntu LTS 12.04 with precise-proposed.
I just had a kernel upgrade from 3.5.0-28-generic to 3.5.0-29-generic.
Now I get the folowing message when I try to start my VirtualBox VM:

    **Error in suplibOsInit**

    Kernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)

    The VirtualBox Linux kernel driver (vboxdrv) is either not 
    loaded or there is a permission problem with /dev/vboxdrv. 
    Please reinstall the kernel module by executing

    '/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup'

    as root. If it is available in your distribution, you should 
    install the DKMS package first. This package keeps track of 
    Linux kernel changes and recompiles the vboxdrv kernel module if 
    necessary.


I remember to have had similar messages 
:doc:`some days ago <0503>`.
But this time I have also::

    $ ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`/updates/dkms/vbox*
    ls: cannot access /lib/modules/3.5.0-29-generic/updates/dkms/vbox*: No such file or directory

So maybe its enough to say::

  $ sudo apt-get install --reinstall virtualbox-dkms

But no::

    ------------------------------
    Deleting module version: 4.1.12
    completely from the DKMS tree.

    Done.

    $ sudo aptitude reinstall dkms

Then it worked.
