The Cosi demo site had generated an interesting traceback 
which lead to another step in the evolution of 
:mod:`lino.modlib.partners` (which is currently 
being used by :mod:`lino.projects.cosi`).
The challenge was to display a table with the ledger invoices of 
a Person or Organisation in a way that works with both 
possible choices for :attr:`lino.ui.Site.partners_app_label`.
The new method :meth:`lino.core.model.Model.get_typed_instance`
is necessary for this. 

New document :ref:`cosi.tested` with a first 
section "Person #115 is not a Partner"
which reproduced the traceback.
