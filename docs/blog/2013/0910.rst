=====================================

Worked on this:

-   In `reception.WaitingVisitors` it should not be allowed to delete a row because 
    that would leave the cal.Event without Guest.
    
I'll first try to simply make all variants of `Visitors` tables 
readonly by setting `editable=False`.

This made me stumble on something similar to what we had a few 
days ago where the `label` of an Actr wasn't inherited.
Now it is the `editable` property.
I applied the same changes for `editable`.

MyWaitingVisitors is maybe not needed as a menu entry since it is also 
a get_admin_main_items. 
But if i remove it then i must edit pcsw_tests.py.
Waiting for user feedback before doing this.

Removed a test case from :ref:`welfare.tested.debts`
because (1) it failed und (2) was rather strange anyway.
