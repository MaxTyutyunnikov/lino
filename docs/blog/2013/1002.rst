Miscellaneous little changes in :ref:`welfare`
----------------------------------------------

- jobs.JobsOverview now displays full name and partner id of clients.

- Changed the logging level from debug to info for certain messages in 
  :manage:`watch_tim`. Principally every modification made by watch_tim 
  should get logged.


- Fixed a test failure which occurred when use_eid_jslib is False 
  and a client must read eID card. This means that Lino is not able to 
  read the card himself. The warning should still appear, but should not 
  be clickable.

- :meth:`TableRequest.__repr__` failed when :meth:`setup` had not yet 
  been called. Added class attributes `filter` and `known_value` with 
  default value None.


Checkin and pull on :ref:`demos`.
