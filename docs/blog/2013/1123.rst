=====================================


Yesterday was my first (Python) project which I published on
**github**, not on googlecode.  Which required a little change in
:ref:`atelier` to have the :file:`README` file's extension be 
`.rst` instead of `.txt` (to instruct github to use the 
right parser) when `env.use_mercurial` is False.
