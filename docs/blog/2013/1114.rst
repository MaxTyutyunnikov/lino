Tutorial about dynamic tables (matrixes)
----------------------------------------

And here is a third new tutorial:
:doc:`/tutorials/matrix_tutorial/index`.


Rendering ForeignKeys to models without `insert_layout`
-------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug reported by Joe:
A ForeignKey field is
rendererd as a TwinButton Combobox: one button to open the selection
list (as with any combo box), the other one to lookup the current value
(by opening a detail window on that object). The bug came because you
can now use the "Lookup" button of a combobox to quickly insert an item
in the selection list (by clicking it when the field is empty).


Updated documentation about permission
--------------------------------------

Joe contributed documentation about Lino's permissions system.
I integrated this into :doc:`/dev/perms`.
