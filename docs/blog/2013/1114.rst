Tutorial about dynamic tables (matrixes)
----------------------------------------

And here is a third new tutorial:
:doc:`/tutorials/matrix_tutorial/index`.


Rendering ForeignKeys to models without `insert_layout`
-------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug reported by Joe:
A ForeignKey field is
rendererd as a TwinButton Combobox: one button to open the selection
list (as with any combo box), the other one to lookup the current value
(by opening a detail window on that object). The bug came because you
can now use the "Lookup" button of a combobox to quickly insert an item
in the selection list (by clicking it when the field is empty).


Updated documentation about permission
--------------------------------------

Joe contributed documentation about Lino's permissions system.
I integrated this into :doc:`/dev/perms`.


Install :ref:`eidreader` on testlino for Gerd
---------------------------------------------

Error handling: when no card is present or no reader connected, 
then the read() function returns a single-line string with the 
error message.


Oops, here is a problem with yesterday's change about the 
default value for :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT`: 

".../lino/projects/std/media/extjs does not exist and SITE.extjs_root is not set."

Because of this new rule we cannot anymore instantiate a dummy 
SITE instance, as was done by :mod:`lino.projects.std.settings`.

Added new setting :setting:`auto_configure_logger_names`
