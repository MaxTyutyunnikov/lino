Is multi-table inheritance bad?
-------------------------------

Daniel and Audrey were so nice to offer me a free copy 
of their book `Two scoops of Django <https://django.2scoops.org/>`_.

I gratefully accept it as a gift and an encouragement for my work on Lino.

Wow! this book is so great! I just can't wait to try all the new ideas I
got already during the five first chapters! Examples: use relative
imports, use pip and virtualenv, move all settings to the code
repository, ... 

... but I stopped at the beginning of chapter 6 because it's too dangerous
to continue right now: I must keep Lino and my mind *stable* during the
next 2 weeks because I'm going to travel to Belgium and show Lino to
potential partners and customers.

The question continued to haunt me, 
however, I had a sleepless night because the authors write:

  Multi-table inheritance, sometimes called ‘concrete inheritance’, 
  is considered by the authors and many other developers to be a 
  bad thing. We strongly recommend against using it.
  
That statement was be a challenge to me: 
I had to either *understand* 
that they are right or *show* that they are wrong.
Sigh!
I had to reopen ticket :doc:`/tickets/22`
although everything there seemed so clear to me!

And after some meditation 
I understood that I am probably wrong and they are right.
We *can* do it without MTI, it just depends on how the user interface handles it!

An important observation seems the fact that  
a Partner is **either** a Person 
**or** an Organization, **not both**.
Another hint is the fact that :mod:`lino.utils.mti` 
will break in Django 1.6.

  
As a proof of concept I wrote the new module :mod:`lino.modlib.partners` 
which is going to replace :mod:`lino.modlib.contacts`.
This lead to a few little optimizations:

- :func:`when_prepared <lino.core.inject.when_prepared>`
  now supports more than one argument, 
  each of them being a model_spec.
- Better error messages at some internal places

But this proof of concept is not finised.
The main challenge is :doc:`/tickets/73`.

Also opened new ticket :doc:`/tickets/72`.
