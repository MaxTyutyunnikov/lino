NameError at /api/courses/CoursesByLine
---------------------------------------

Displaying the detail of a course line 
caused an :ref:`ise` "global name 'format_time' is not defined"

To fix the bug was a matter of two minutes. But then... 

... but then wanted to quickly write a test case which reproduces 
this bug.
This is tested by doing an http GET using the Django test client.

I realized that I want a new class 
:class:`lino.utils.test.DemoTestCase`
which does something similar to what until 
now was possible only using tested docs: run a test on the demo 
database without having Django create and populate a test database.
