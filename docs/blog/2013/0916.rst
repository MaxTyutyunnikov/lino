We are
testing the :ref:`davlink` applet on a customer's site.
Also updated on the docs page :ref:`davlink.client`.

Even after having given permission (using policytool)
to run :ref:`davlink`, 
we got  the following  exception::

    java.lang.SecurityException: JAR manifest codebase mismatch for http://testlino.xx.yyy.be/media/lino/applets/DavLink.jar
        at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployManifestChecker.verify(Unknown Source)
        at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployManifestChecker.verify(Unknown Source)
        ...

This is because of a wrong codebase manifest attribute
(which have been introduced in 
`JDK 7u25
<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u25-relnotes-1955741.html#jar-att>`__
and are explained in:
`Preventing RIAs from Being Repurposed
<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/no_redeploy.html>`_)

Changing the content of manifest.txt to the following didn't work either::

  Permissions: all-permissions
  Codebase: *

But here another piece of information:
`Deploying Without Codebase
<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/deploymentInDepth/deployingWithoutCodebase.html>`_
