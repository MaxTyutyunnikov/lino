Variable row height
-------------------

The :ref:`logos` project caused a new feature for Lino:
the new class attribute 
:attr:`variable_row_height <lino.core.tables.AbstractTable.variable_row_height>`.

Before and after:

.. image:: 1012a.png
  :scale: 45
.. image:: 1014.png
  :scale: 45
  
  
Comments
--------

And another new Lino feature caused 
by the :ref:`logos` project:
:mod:`lino.modlib.comments`.
This will be Lino's custom solution to replace
`Django's comments framework
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/>`_
which has  been deprecated because "Most users will be better served 
with a custom solution, or a hosted product like Disqus."

:mod:`lino.modlib.comments` in turn caused another new feature:
Lino now supports `insert_layout` with only one element:
it uses then a hard-coded height of 10 lines.
You can always specify your own window_size.




Where to get free bibles
------------------------
  
Should :ref:`logos` have its own copy of bibles? 
Or is it enough to generate links to existing online bible servers?

For example here is how "1Mos 1:2" is being served by two German 
online bibles:

- die-bibel.de 
  (documented `here <http://www.die-bibel.de/online-bibeln/link-service/bibel-link-service/>`_)
  : http://www.die-bibel.de/bibelstelle/1.Mose%201%2C2/
  
-   bibel-online.net : http://bibel-online.net/buch/elberfelder_1905/1_mose/1/#2

Answer: no we can't simply rely on external links.
:ref:`logos` should come with its own copies 
of the different bible editions and install them into its database. 

- One reason for this is simply performance:
  a web request is still more expensive than a database lookup.
  
- Another reason is that we certainly want 
  to offer text searching, and I don't know about any service who 
  would do that for us (which is of course a pity because full-fledged 
  text searching (with e.g. language-specific fuzzy matches) 
  is a whole chapter on its own).

The `bibel-online.net` site looks more open-minded. 
It also features a cool `dual view
<http://bibel-online.net/buch/dual/biblia_hebraica/1_mose/2/elberfelder_1905/1_mose/2>`_.

Oh, and I am sorry to see that they have had problems caused by copyright:

    Aufgrund zunehmender Kommerzialisierung und Konzentrationsbestrebungen 
    christlicher Quellenanbieter wurde auch uns vom Rat der EKD, vertreten 
    durch die Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft Stuttgart, die seit 1996 bestehende 
    und unbefristete Lizenz für die Fortführung des Angebots der 
    "Luther-Bibel 1984" zum 31.12.2007 ohne Angabe von Gründen entzogen. 

    (`Stellungnahme zum Lizenzentzug der Luther 1984 durch den Rat der EKD
    <http://bibel-online.net/luther1984/>`_)

For me this is just another confirmation of my belief that copyright 
should be abolished... 

Unfortunately my belief about copyright won't change the world:
Copyright is here to stay with us for at least the next years.

So :ref:`logos` is going to serve only those bible editions who 
*want* us to serve them. 
Which means that copyrighted editions are out 
of question, at least as long as there is no patron to sponsor the 
different license fees (and the wage for me or my successor 
because i wouldn't continue to work for free on the project in that case).

And yes, I *cannot* yet publish the source code 
of my :ref:`logos` project (nor setup an online server) 
because the screenshots are partly based on **illegaly** downloaded 
material.
If I'd publish these fixtures, I'd risk a legal pursuit.
No thanks.

I wrote a script `get_eb.py` which uses BeautifulSoup to extract 
the 1905 version of the German Elberfelder bible from 
`bibel-online.net`. 
That looks promising but needs some more work,
and I'm not even sure whether they like it
(even though they seem open-minded).

So the next question is: 
where can i find non-copyrighted bible editions?

"Good enough" is good enough

Note à part:

:ref:`davlink` and :file:`/usr/bin/X11`
---------------------------------------


:ref:`davlink` fails to scan the file system of a machine 
running Ubuntu and SUN Java 1.6::

    java.io.IOException: Cannot run program
    "/usr/bin//X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/libreoffice":
    error=40, Zu viele Ebenen aus symbolischen Links

This is because :file:`/usr/bin/X11` is 
a symlink to :file:`/usr/bin`. (And it seems that some parts of the system 
rely on this, so we cannot change it).
