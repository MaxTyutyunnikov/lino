Switching from GPL to BSD
=========================

My decision to switch from GPL to BSD was already done 
when splitting the first versions of djangosite and North from Lino in March 2013, 
but I didn't yet take time 
to do the dirty work of adapting the copyright headers in source files accordingly.
Now I did it for both :mod:`djangosite` and :mod:`north`.
See also :ref:`djangosite.changes` and :ref:`north.changes`.

Why do I switch from GPL to BSD? 
Because I have become more reasonable :-)
I still believe that copyright is evil and should be abolished,
and the GPL uses the copyleft concept to fight against copyright,
but I understood that fighting against it is --for me!-- a waste of time.
I believe that you should fight *for the good* things, not *against the bad* ones...
And you cannot ask Beelzebul to fight against Satan...

Lino itself must yet remain GPL as long as the ExtJS and Ext.ensible 
user interface are still integrated. The same applies to Lino-Welfare.
