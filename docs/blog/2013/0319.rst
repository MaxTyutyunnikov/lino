sphinxcontrib-newsfeed
----------------------

I discovered and had a look at 
`sphinxcontrib-newsfeed <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-newsfeed>`_,
a well made Sphinx extension to generate an rss feed from my blog entries.

What I'm missing is that it lacks an auto-discovery function. 
I have to add myself every blog entry also to the ``.. feed::`` 
directive. For example in my :file:`index.rst` I have::

    .. feed::
       :rss: index.rss
       :title: Luc's blog

       blog/index
       blog/2013/0318
       blog/2013/0319
       
It would be enough to add a ``:glob:`` option as for ``.. toctree::``.


Changes
-------

- Removed some internal dependencies from djangosite to north.
- Added German translations for the new things in :ref:`welfare.jobs`.
- There were still some `print_` function calls instead of `print` 
  statements hanging around. E.g. in 
  :ref:`lino.tutorial.auto_create` and
  :ref:`lino.tutorial.human`.
