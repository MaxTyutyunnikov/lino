Lino needs a new name!
----------------------

My wife and I were thinking about a logo for Lino (see
:blogref:`20130926`), and I noticed that I feel
certain problems:

- Resemblance with "Linux" (e.g. my non-programmer friends usually
  mix them up)
- It is used by certain specialized products in printing technology
  (Linotronic, Linoprint)
- Americans don't know how to pronounce it


It is not easy to change a name, but I'd rather do it now than in 5
years.

... and oops: while surfing around I discovered that 
"Lino" is registered trademark of a 
German software company (http://www.lino.de).
So now it is clear: Lino needs a new name!

Suggestions are welcome.
