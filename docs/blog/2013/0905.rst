:class:`lino.mixins.BeIdCardHolder`:

- `eid_info` now adds the "Must read eID card!" message also when the 
  `card_valid_until` has passed. 
  And uses red background color when that message appears.
  And `card_valid_until` is bold when it has passed.

- disabled_fields : the card fields are no longer disabled for 
  :ref:`UserLevels.admin`
  
  (Ouch, that innocent ":ref:`UserLevels.admin`"
  inadvertently made me dive into writing documentation 
  though there are more urgent things to do...)

- New table :ref:`welfare.pcsw.AllClients` shows all columns.
  Use this for manually modifying eid card fields which are otherwise 
  nowhere.

- Optimized the layout of the detail of 
  :ref:`welfare.reception.Clients`.
  The photo is now relatively visible.
