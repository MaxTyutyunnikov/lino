Still working on the "pip install lino" problem.
Which takes so much time because I want to solve the "better automated testing" problem.


- Moved the uiless tutorial from lino to north where it is 
  called The Polls tutorial. This caused yet another testing 
  method :func:`run_bash_tests <djangosite.utils.fablib.run_bash_tests>`.
  

- Tried the solution to move the `media` directory 
  one level down into the `lino` package.
