After concluding yesterday evening that 
:doc:`/tickets/74` is impossible to solve,
and after some hours of sleep,
I changed my mind again:

  `settings.LINO` will become `settings.SITE`,
  and `lino.Lino` will become `django_site.Site`.
  Later I will move that code to a new project
  `django-site
  <https://code.google.com/p/django-site/>`_.
  
This change was quite some -rather dull- work. 
On a Saturday.
But I like the result.

TODO:

- move also dumpy and babel to django-site. 
- change babel to do nothing if `Site.languages` is None.
- split the docs. What will be the home url for django-site?
