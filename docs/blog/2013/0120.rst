I discovered 
`extjs-public
<http://code.google.com/p/extjs-public/>`_,
a repository containing the latest public release of ExtJS.
This is now being used as default value 
for :attr:`lino.Lino.extjs_base_url`.
One thing less to install before getting started with Lino.


I also found a solution for ticket :doc:`/tickets/69`.
