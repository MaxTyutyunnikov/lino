I couldn't wait to do a first step for splitting Lino into more 
digestable parts.

The idea is to make the Lino kernel less intrusive. 
For people who want to use Lino's database migration system 
and startup signal within their existing Django applications, 
but who don't want to have Lino manage their URLconfs and replace 
their Django Admin.

I basically moved lino.ui.extjs to `lino.web`,
and split web-specific functionality 
out of `lino.Lino` into `lino.web.Lino`.
:checkin:`79edb8b79c85`.

For existing applications these changes are invisible
except for one detail:

- The app_label ot the "system tables" 
  SiteConfig, HelpText and TextFieldTemplate 
  is now "web" instead of "lino".
