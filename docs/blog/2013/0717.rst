Update your :meth:`get_installed_apps <lino.ui.Site.get_installed_apps>`
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After yesterday's changes, some tests were failing 
because :mod:`lino.ui` is no longer automatically being 
yielded by :meth:`lino.ui.Site.get_installed_apps`.

This change was necessary because otherwise it was impossible 
to override the "ui" app
(and :mod:`lino_welfare` now does exactly that).

This forced me to tidy up a few things.
I decided that :mod:`lino.ui` is no longer an app. 
The models SiteConfig, HelpText and TextFieldTemplate 
and some system fixtures and tests
are now defined in a new module :mod:`lino.modlib.system`.
References to these models have now the app_label "system" and no longer "ui".

The :mod:`lino.ui` module remains, but it is no longer a Django app. 
It is an important core module.
:class:`lino.ui.Site` is the base for all Lino Site classes.
The separation between :class:`lino.Site` and 
:class:`lino.ui.Site` is currently not important. 
It exists theoretically in case one day somebody comes who wants 
Lino, but wants to write her own user interface.

Existing Lino applications must add :mod:`lino.modlib.system`
to the list of apps yielded by 
:meth:`lino.ui.Site.get_installed_apps`.

More detailed instructions in :doc:`/changes`.
