Worked on 
:ref:`welfare.reception.ExpectedGuests`
and
:ref:`welfare.reception.WaitingGuests`.
They start to be ready.

New action "Appointment" (pcsw.Clients.create_event = CreateClientEvent())
for checking in visitors without appointment.
This action is currently declared `show_in_workflow`, so it is not in 
the top toolbar but in the workflow buttons (Status tab).
    



TODO: 
- Checkin action should check for valid eid card and issue a warning when appropriate.
