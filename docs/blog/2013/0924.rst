Fixed some last-minute bugs
---------------------------

Discovered a bug in the generated Javascript:
The problem 
"Size or layout of params_panel is not correct 
when opened for the first time." was not yet completely solved:
In a params_panel with only one row of fields 
(e.g. welfare.contacts.Persons) they caused an endless loop of 
resize events. 

Fixed using changes in js_render_ParamsPanelSubclass and other places.
Here be dragons.
We now assume that a params_panel must have `autoHeight: true`,
which means that it may not any vflex row.
Because the panel had layout "fit" which is wrong, 
it must be always layout "form" and 

Discovered and fixed another AJAX bug: 
In an answer to `/callbacks/123456` was missing a "/".
This one was introduced yesterday by the 
new :attr:`site_prefix <lino.site.Site.site_prefix>`


A third (less severe) bug was that an internal server error
which occured during a Lino.list_action_handler was not reported 
to the user. Lino displayed the loadMask forever.

All these tests had slipped through the test suite
(to track such bugs in the Javascript code I would have to use 
Jasmine...)



Release
-------

Despite the above last-minute bugs I decided to make a relase and an 
upgrade in Eupen tonight.
