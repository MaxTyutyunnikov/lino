==================================

Continued to work
on the :ref:`welfare.reception` module.

Added a "Quick appointment" action which
creates (1) a calendar event that belongs to the selected user
and (2) a checked-in Guest for this event.

Actions
-------

I added a new virtual column
:meth:`action_buttons <lino.core.model.Model.action_buttons>`
which is similar to the existing
:meth:`workflow_buttons <lino.core.model.Model.workflow_buttons>` column.
The new attribute :attr:`lino.core.actions.Action.show_in_row_actions`
defines whether this action should be displayed in this column.

The difference is subtle:
it does not display the state, nor does it automatically include 
any state change actions.
The whole system for defining actions is not yet really 
transparent and consistent.
