A command to test them all (continued)
--------------------------------------

Yesterday I was already happy with something like the 
following in my `.bash_aliases`::

    PROJECTS="atelier site north lino welfare"

    function rt() { 
    for i in $PROJECTS; do
    echo ========= RUNNING TEST SUITE FOR $i =====
    cd ~/hgwork/$i
    python setup.py -q test
    [ "$?" == 0 ] || return 1
    done
    echo "All tests passed (for projects $PROJECTS)"
    echo "Congratulations!"
    }

But today I want more. I wrote a script 
`/scripts/per_project` as part 
of the `atelier` package. Now I can simply open a shell and type::

  $ pp test # run all tests on all projects
  $ pp adocs # build all docs on all projects
  $ pp pub # publish docs on all projects
