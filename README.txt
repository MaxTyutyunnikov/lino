Lino README.txt
===============

The Lino homepage at http://lino.sourceforge.net is currently obsolete.
 
Lino is a collection of free software written or maintained by Luc
Saffre.  Luc's vision is that Lino becomes the first really good
database application framework available for general public use, but
currently this is just a vision...

This Lino distribution contains some works from third-party authors:

- [file /src/snakeserver] a slightly modified copy of Irmen de Jong's
  Snakelets 1.3 which is licensed under a MIT licence.
  
- [file /scripts/rsync.py] is an unmodified copy of Vivian De Smedt's
  `rsync` implementation.
  http://www.vdesmedt.com/~vds2212/rsync.html

- [file /src/forum/] contains snippets from diverse sources.
